Requires loans also to community learning centers to connect and improve broadband services, and to educational service agencies for building or repairing elementary schools, secondary schools, or other school facilities that provide free public education.\n\nGrants congressional consent to states for interstate compacts to establish multistate infrastructure banks.\n\nDirects the Secretary to make grants to such banks to provide initial capital for such loans.\n\nRequires states to contribute from nonfederal sources at least 25% of the amount of each federal capitalization grant made to the state and contributed to the bank.\n\nLists types of projects eligible for such bank loans.\n\nRequires borrowers to use, to the maximum extent practicable, green construction or renovation practices that are consistent with: (1) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building rating standards, (2) Energy Star standards, (3) Collaborative for High Performance Schools (CHPS) criteria, (4) Green Building Initiative environmental design and rating standards (Green Globes), or (5) equivalent standards adopted by the entities that have jurisdiction over them."
