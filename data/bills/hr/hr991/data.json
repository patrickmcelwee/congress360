Expresses the sense of Congress that DOD should expedite the design and manufacture of the button, as well as mechanisms to facilitate its issuance.\n\nMakes such button available retroactively to the child of any member satisfying such eligibility conditions before the enactment of this Act.\n\nRequires DOD to notify members with qualifying service since September 11, 2001, of the availability of the button."
