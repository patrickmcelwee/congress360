Commerce shall ensure that each radar conforms with the same standards that apply to radars operated through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including standards relating to the use of dual-polarization technology or other technologies included in Weather Surveillance Radar, 1988, Doppler (WSR-88D) radars.\n\nWhen determining the location for construction of a radar meeting the requirements of this Act, Commerce shall consider nearby counties that have populations over 130,000 and do not otherwise have radar beam coverage below 10,00 feet from such Doppler radars.\n\nCommerce shall report to Congress on the Doppler weather radar sites that need to be constructed or acquired to meet this Act's requirements."
