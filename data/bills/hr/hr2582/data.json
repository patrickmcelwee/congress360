(Sec. 5) It is also the sense of Congress that HHS should:\n\n periodically monitor and improve the risk adjustment model for payments to MA organizations to ensure that it accurately accounts for beneficiary risk; closely examine and adjust as necessary the current MA risk adjustment methodology to ensure that plans enrolling beneficiaries with the greatest health care needs receive adequate reimbursement to deliver high-quality care and other services to help beneficiaries avoid costly complications and further progression of chronic conditions; and reconsider the implementation of changes in the MA risk adjustment methodology finalized for 2016 and, to the extent appropriate, use the risk methodology finalized in 2015 for one additional year."
