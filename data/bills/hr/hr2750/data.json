The TSA may conduct a Rap Back Service pilot program, in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), to determine the feasibility of full implementation of a service through which the TSA would be notified of a change in status of an individual holding a valid credential granting unescorted access to sensitive airport areas across eligible TSA-regulated populations. (The FBI Rap Back Service notifies authorized agencies of criminal, and, in limited cases, civil activity of individuals that occurs after the initial processing and retention of criminal or civil transactions.)\n\nCertain pilot program procedures are prescribed regarding notification only of a change with respect to a disqualifying offense under the credential vetting program.\n\n(Sec. 3) The TSA, within 60 days after enactment of this Act, shall report to Congress on the status of plans to conduct the Rap Back Service pilot program."
