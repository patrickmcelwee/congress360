The Bureau may also allow such reduction for a prisoner performing exceptionally meritorious service or duties of outstanding importance in connection with institutional operations.\n\nIf, during the term of imprisonment, a prisoner commits any offense or violates Bureau regulations, all or any part of his or her earned good time may be forfeited. The Bureau shall provide the criteria and means for restoration of any forfeited or lost good time."
