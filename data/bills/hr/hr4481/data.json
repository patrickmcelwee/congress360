Priority should also be considered in countries where there are chronically underserved and marginalized populations, or populations affected by conflict or crisis.\n\nUSAID shall designate a Senior Coordinator of United States Government Actions to Provide Basic Education Assistance, who shall have primary responsibility for the oversight and coordination of all U.S. government resources and international activities to promote quality universal basic education."
