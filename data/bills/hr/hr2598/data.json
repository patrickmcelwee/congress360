Exempts those states from specified administrative penalties.\n\nRevises the terms \"driving while intoxicated\" and \"driving under the influence\" to accord with this Act. Subjects repeat offenders to minimum civil and criminal penalties for driving a motor vehicle while impaired by marijuana in those states.\n\nDirects the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to:\n\n study through scientific testing the extent to which marijuana impairs an individual's ability to drive a motor vehicle; and issue a report, and make it available electronically to the public, with recommendations to states on how to prevent marijuana-impaired driving."
