    "text": "Restoring Equity, Saving Coverage, and Undoing Errors Act of 2015 or the RESCUE America's Health Care Act of 2015\n\nThis bill applies only: (1) if the Supreme Court determines that the premium tax credit under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) is not applicable to health plans purchased through the federal health insurance exchange, and (2) in states without a state health insurance exchange.\n\nThis bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit for individuals with health insurance who are ineligible for federal health care and not enrolled in an employer-subsidized group health plan.\n\nThe Department of the Treasury must make payments to health insurers on behalf of taxpayers eligible for the tax credit.\n\nThis bill repeals certain provisions of PPACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 relating to health insurance, health savings accounts, and health flexible spending accounts. Provisions amended by the repealed provisions are restored.\n\nAny health plan fulfills an individual's requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.\n\nDental plans no longer need to provide pediatric dental benefits to be offered on a health insurance exchange.\n\nThis bill amends the Public Health Service Act to define individual health pools (IHPs) as nonprofit entities that form health insurance risk pools. IHPs are prohibited from conditioning membership on an individual's health status and must offer the same coverage to all members. State benefit requirements and restrictions on premium variation do not apply to IHPs.\n\nHealth insurers in the individual market must offer coverage to all individuals.\n\nA health insurer may exclude coverage for a preexisting condition or vary premiums based on health status only for individuals who have not had continuous coverage for the last 18 months."
