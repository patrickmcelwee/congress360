Whenever a House or Senate Committee reports a bill or joint resolution proposing to repeal or amend all or part of a statute, it must include in its report or in an accompanying document:\n\n the entire text of each section of the statute proposed to be repealed or amended, and a comparative print of each amendment to the section of the statute that the bill or joint resolution proposes to make. Neither chamber, nor Congress jointly, may dispense with or otherwise waive or modify the requirements of this Act.\n\nAny Act of Congress that was considered as a bill or resolution in the House or Senate in violation of this Act shall have no force or effect, and no legal, equitable, regulatory, civil, or criminal action may be brought under it."
