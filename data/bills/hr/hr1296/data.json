(However, such execution shall not constitute a major federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.) Interior is authorized to take steps necessary to implement the agreement and such Act.\n\nThe Bands will continue to possess federally reserved rights and other water rights held in trust by the United States. In any proceeding involving the assertion, enforcement, or defense of such rights, the United States shall not be a required party and and any decision by the United States regarding participation in any such proceeding shall not be subject to judicial review or give rise to any claim for relief against the United States.\n\nCongress confirms that the benefits to allottees in the agreement are equitable and fully satisfy their water rights."
