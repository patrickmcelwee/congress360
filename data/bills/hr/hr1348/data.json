Such insurance fulfills an individual's requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage but is not eligible for premium assistance and is not treated as a bronze, silver, gold, or platinum plan. Currently, health insurance must provide the essential health benefits to be sold on health insurance exchanges and fulfill an individual's requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage."
