    "text": "Government Employee Accountability Act\n\nSets forth guidelines for placing career employees of the Senior Executive Service (SES) on investigative leave. Defines \"investigative leave\" as a temporary absence without duty for disciplinary reasons, of a period not greater than 90 days.\n\nAuthorizes a federal agency to: (1) place an SES employee on investigative leave, without loss of pay and without charge to annual or sick leave, only for misconduct, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or misappropriation of funds; (2) place such employee on leave without pay if such employee's conduct is flagrant and such employee intentionally engaged in such conduct; or (3) remove such employee if such employee acted in a manner that endangers the interest of the agency mission and the removal is deemed necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States.\n\nRequires an agency head to periodically review the investigation into the conduct of an SES employee placed on investigative leave and take certain actions with respect to such employee at the end of a period of investigative leave, including removal, suspension without pay, or reinstatement to duty. Grants an employee placed on investigative leave certain rights, including: (1) advance written notice of, and the right to answer, charges; (2) the right to be represented by an attorney; and (3) the right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board.\n\nIncludes misappropriation of funds as a ground in suspending or reinstating an SES employee or placing such employee in another civil service position."
