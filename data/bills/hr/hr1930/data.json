Exempts from such rescission any fossil-fueled power plant project located in a Least Developed Country if no other economically feasible alternative exists, and the project uses the most efficient technology available.\n\nTerminates the Office of Fossil Energy Research and Development in DOE and related implementation authority.\n\nProhibits the Department of Agriculture from making loans under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to carry out projects that will use fossil fuel.\n\nProhibits the use of Department of Transportation funds to award any grant or other direct assistance to any rail or port project that transports fossil fuel.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) limit or repeal provisions allowing tax incentives for investment in fossil fuels, (2) increase the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund financing rate, and (3) impose a 13% tax on the removal price of any taxable crude oil or natural gas from the Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nRepeals the corporate income tax exemption for publicly traded partnerships with qualifying income and gains from activities relating to fossil fuels.\n\nDesignates the Powder River Basin in southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming as a coal producing region.\n\nEliminates accelerated depreciation for property that is receiving a subsidy for fossil fuel production."
