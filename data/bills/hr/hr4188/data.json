    "as": "Passed House without amendment", 
    "date": "2015-12-10", 
    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nCoast Guard Authorization Act of 2015\n\nTITLE I--AUTHORIZATIONS (Sec. 101) This bill authorizes appropriations for the Coast Guard for FY2016-FY2017 as well as an end-of-year strength for active duty personnel of 43,000 for each of them and specified average military training student loads.\n\nThe President shall submit to Congress along with the FY2017, FY2019, and quadrennial budgets a Coast Guard manpower requirements plan.\n\nThere must be a prior authorization of appropriations for the Coast Guard Reserve program and the removal of bridges over U.S. navigable waters that obstruct navigation. But the requirement for prior authorization of appropriations shall no longer apply to research, development, test, or evaluation related to intelligence systems and capabilities.\n\nThe Coast Guard may use certain FY2016-FY2017 funds to select a design for and construct an icebreaker capable of buoy tending to enhance icebreaking capacity on the Great Lakes. The bill authorizes appropriations for these fiscal years for preacquisition activities for a new polar icebreaker, including initial specification development and feasibility studies.\n\nTITLE II--COAST GUARD\n\n(Sec. 201) The grade of the Vice Commandant of the Coast Guard shall be increased from vice admiral to admiral, and the Chief of Staff of the Coast Guard shall be a vice admiral.\n\n(Sec. 202) The President may designate within the executive branch, outside the Coast Guard or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the Department of Commerce, positions of importance and responsibility held by officers with the grade of vice admiral.\n\n(Sec. 203) The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may have remitted or cancelled any part of a person's indebtedness to the United States or any U.S. instrumentality if: (1) the indebtedness was incurred while the person served on active duty as a Coast Guard member; and (2) remitting or cancelling the indebtedness is in the best U.S. interest.\n\n(Sec. 204) The test and evaluation master plan for any Level 1 or Level 2 acquisition project or program must identify:\n\n the performance data to be used to determine whether key performance parameters have been resolved, and the test and evaluation results required to demonstrate that a capability, asset, or subsystem meets performance requirements. The report accompanying the Coast Guard's annual capital investment plan shall include a life-cycle cost estimate and specified impact assessments for each new capital asset, as well as recommended funding levels.\n\nThe Coast Guard shall:\n\n implement a standard for tracking operational days at sea for cutters that does not include days during which they are undergoing maintenance or repair; submit to Congress a revised fleet mix analysis of Coast Guard fixed wing aircraft; include in the biennial long-term major acquisitions plan the numbers and types of cutters and aircraft to be decommissioned or to be acquired, together with certain estimated funding levels; and report to Congress quarterly updates of the assessment of the risks associated with all current major acquisition programs. (Sec. 205) The Coast Guard Auxiliary may patrol a waterway only if: (1) it is navigable for purposes of the Coast Guard jurisdiction, or (2) a state or other proper authority has requested the patrol.\n\nThe Coast Guard shall review the waterways patrolled by the Auxiliary in the most recently completed fiscal year to determine whether they are eligible or ineligible for patrol.\n\n(Sec. 206) The bill reduces from 90 to 30 days the deadline for the Coast Guard to notify Congress before approving a community as Coast Guard City, USA.\n\n(Sec. 207) The Coast Guard may contract for the acquisition of Polar Icebreakers and associated equipment using incremental funding. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating (the Secretary in this Act unless otherwise noted) shall:\n\n complete a materiel condition assessment with respect to the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Polar Sea, and determine whether it is cost effective to reactivate the Polar Sea when compared with other options as part of a strategy to maintain polar icebreaking services. (Sec. 208) The Secretary may not before January 1, 2018: (1) close a Coast Guard air facility that was in operation on November 30, 2014; or (2) retire, transfer, relocate, or deploy an aviation asset from such an air facility for the purpose of closing it.\n\nThe Secretary may close or terminate operations at such an air facility after that date only if:\n\n remaining search and rescue capabilities maintain the safety of the maritime public in the facility's area; regional or local prevailing weather and marine conditions, including water temperatures or unusual tide and current conditions, do not require the facility's continued operation; and Coast Guard search and rescue standards related to search and response times are met. The Secretary may, however, implement any reasonable management efficiencies within an air station and air facility network, such as modifying the operational posture of units or reallocating resources as necessary to ensure the safety of the maritime public nationwide.\n\nThe Secretary shall develop and submit to Congress rotary wing strategic plans, including contingency and capital investment plans, to adequately address contingencies arising from potential future aviation casualties or the planned or unplanned retirement of rotary wing airframes to avoid to the greatest extent practicable any substantial gap or diminishment in Coast Guard operational capabilities.\n\n(Sec. 210) The Secretary shall establish a process for the discontinuance of an aid to navigation (other than a seasonal or temporary aid) established, maintained, or operated by the Coast Guard.\n\n(Sec. 211) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall assess the efficacy of the Coast Guard's Standard Operational Planning Process with respect to annual mission performance measures.\n\n(Sec. 212) If DHS determines that there are at least two such communications systems certified by the Department of Defense Joint Interoperability Test Center (DOD JITC), the Secretary shall carry out a pilot program across at least three components of the DHS to assess the effectiveness of a communications system that:\n\n provides for multiagency collaboration and interoperability and wide-area, secure, and peer-invitation-based and acceptance-based multimedia communications; is DOD JITC-certified; and is composed of commercially available, off-the-shelf technology. (Sec. 213) The Secretary shall establish an education program for Coast Guard members and employees that:\n\n offers a master's degree in maritime operations; is relevant to professional development; provides resident and distant education options, including ability to use them both; and is conducted using existing academic programs at an accredited public academic institution located near a significant number of Coast Guard, maritime, and other DHS law enforcement personnel, and can simulate operations normally conducted at a command center. (Sec. 214) The Coast Guard shall develop and implement a plan to conduct every two years a multirater assessment for each Coast Guard: (1) flag officer, (2) member of the Senior Executive Service, and (3) officer nominated for promotion to the grade of flag officer.\n\nA multirater assessment is a review that seeks opinion from members senior to the reviewee as well as the reviewee's peers and subordinates.\n\nThe Coast Guard shall also: (1) develop and offer at least once each year a training course for flag officers and employees on the workings of the Congress, and (2) report to Congress on Coast Guard leadership development.\n\n(Sec. 215) This bill repeals requirements and Enlisted Personnel Board procedures for the involuntary retirement of enlisted Coast Guard members with 20 or more years of active military service.\n\n(Sec. 216) The Coast Guard shall: (1) audit annually the pay and allowances for the members transferred to new units during the year, and (2) report to Congress on alternative methods for notifying members of the Coast Guard of their monthly earnings.\n\n(Sec. 217) DHS shall transfer to DOD, from amounts appropriated for Coast Guard operating expenses, or from amounts appropriated for the retired pay for former Coast Guard members, an amount representing the actuarial valuation of treatment or care (not provided under TRICARE):\n\n that DOD shall provide to current or former members of the Coast Guard and their dependents at facilities under DOD or military department jurisdiction (except those Medicare-eligible or for whom treatment or care payment is made from the Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund), and for which a reimbursement would otherwise be made. No transfer shall be made under this section for any period during which the Coast Guard operates as a service in the Navy.\n\n(Sec. 218) The Coast Guard may on a sole source basis enter into a contract, cooperative agreement, lease, or licensing agreement with a qualified tax-exempt nonprofit organization established by the Coast Guard Academy Alumni Association solely to support academic research and apply for and administer federal, state, or other educational research grants on behalf of the Coast Guard Academy.\n\n(Sec. 219) The Secretary shall not expend any funds appropriated to the Coast Guard (currently, any federal funds) for the engineering, design, or construction of a National Coast Guard Museum. This allows the expenditure of other federal funds for the Museum.\n\nThe priority use of federal operation and maintenance funds for the Museum should be to preserve and protect historic Coast Guard artifacts (as under current law), including the design, fabrication, and installation of exhibits or displays in which such artifacts are included.\n\n(Sec. 220) The DHS Inspector General, when investigating an allegation of misconduct by a flag officer or member of the Senior Executive Service serving in the Coast Guard, shall do so in a manner consistent with DOD policies and consult with the DOD Inspector General.\n\n(Sec. 221) The Secretary shall issue procedures and criteria, including those of DOD, to use in determining whether the disability of a Coast Guard member is combat-related and so eligible for combat-related special compensation.\n\nSuch a disability shall include one incurred during aviation duty, diving duty, rescue swimmer or similar duty, and hazardous service duty onboard a small vessel (such as surfman duty):\n\n in the performance of duties for which certain special or incentive pay was paid; in the performance of duties related to law enforcement, including drug or migrant interdiction, defense readiness, or search and rescue; or while engaged in a training exercise for the performance of such a duty. (Sec. 222) The Secretary shall promulgate a rule, policy, or memorandum providing leave associated with the birth or adoption of a child to Coast Guard officers and enlisted members that is similar to and equal in duration and compensation to any similar rule promulgated by the Secretary of the Navy.\n\nTITLE III--SHIPPING AND NAVIGATION\n\n(Sec. 301) This bill suspends application of the requirement that a passenger vessel be equipped with survival craft that ensures that no part of an individual is immersed in water, and applies it only to vessels that operate in cold waters and that are built or undergo a major conversion after January 1, 2016.\n\nThe Secretary may:\n\n revise regulations for lifesaving equipment and arrangements for small passenger vessels to provide a higher standard of safety than current regulations, and allow a passenger vessel to be equipped with a life-saving appliance or arrangement of an innovative or novel design that provides an equal or higher standard of safety than currently required.
