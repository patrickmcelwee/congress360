For purposes of such review, the Comptroller General shall have: (1) access to and the right to examine and copy all corporation records the Comptroller General deems relevant, and (2) access to and the right to interview any corporation employee or volunteer the Comptroller General believes to have relevant knowledge.\n\nThe Comptroller General may: (1) subpoena a record or employee of the corporation, and (2) bring a civil action in U.S. district court for the District of Columbia to enforce compliance with such subpoena.\n\nThe corporation's Office of the Ombudsman must enhance dispute resolution regarding concerns raised by stakeholders regarding the corporation and regularly report to the corporation's board of governors information on trends and patterns on concerns communicated to the Office regarding the corporation. The Office must make information available on its website on how to submit concerns about the organization.\n\nThe bill requires audits, every three years, by: (1) the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration of the corporation's revenues, expenditures, and governance; (2) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Inspector General of the corporation's disaster assistance services; and (3) the U.S. Agency for International Development Inspector General of the corporation's international activities.\n\nDHS must: (1) conduct a one-year pilot program with the corporation to develop mechanisms for DHS to better leverage social media to improve preparedness and response capabilities, and (2) annually report on the extent to which DHS partnered with the corporation in furtherance of preparedness and response capabilities."
