DOD may waive this restriction for national security.\n\nIf the public debt reaches the statutory limit, the following obligations must have equal priority over all other U.S. obligations:\n\n principal and interest on debt held by the public, pay and allowances for members of the Armed Forces on active duty, salaries for DOD civilian employees, and salaries for DOD contractors. The funds and authorities provided by this bill are available until the earliest of January 1, 2016, or enactment of specified appropriations legislation."
