Supplemental reports are also authorized. Boards of inquiry are limited to one that may appointed for each dispute during a 90-day period.\n\nGovernors may also petition for injunctions against such labor or management actions affecting ports in their states or territories.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board, for each dispute, shall take not more than one secret ballot for the same employees in any 30-day period.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office shall study the West Coast ports slowdown to:\n\n study the economic impact of the slowdowns and congestion caused by the negotiations on the nation as a whole as well as each port, review steps taken by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) to resolve the dispute, identify steps FMCS and the Administration could have taken sooner to facilitate an agreement, and determine what legislative changes could strengthen these tools and result in more timely intervention."
