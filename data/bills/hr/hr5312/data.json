Participating federal agencies, working through the National Science and Technology Council, shall develop, and update every five years, a strategic plan for the Program.\n\n The bill replaces the National Research and Education Network with a National Coordination Office, which the Office of Science and Technology Policy shall maintain, and which shall give technical and administrative support to participating federal agencies.\n\nThe bill repeals the authorization for a Next Generation Internet program.\n\nThe Program shall encourage participating agencies to support large-scale, long-term, interdisciplinary research and development activities in networking and information technology directed toward agency mission areas that have the potential for significant contributions to national economic competitiveness and for other significant societal benefits.\n\nThe National Coordination Office may conduct workshops and other activities on research areas of emerging importance.\n\nThe National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Department of Energy, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Education shall each engage in specified research and development activities in conjunction with the Program."
