The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nDisclosure Modernization and Simplification Act of 2015\n\n (Sec. 2) Directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue regulations permitting issuers to submit a summary page on annual and transition report form 10-K if each item on that page cross-references electronically or otherwise the material contained in form 10-K to which the item relates.\n\n(Sec. 3) Requires the SEC to revise regulation S-K (Standard Instructions for Filing Forms under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975) in order to:\n\n reduce the burden on smaller issuers, including emerging growth companies, accelerated filers, and smaller reporting companies (while still providing all material information to investors); and eliminate duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or unnecessary provisions. (Sec. 4) Directs the SEC to study ways to: (1) modernize and simplify requirements in regulation S-K, and (2) evaluate information delivery and presentation methods as well as explore methods to discourage repetition and disclosure of immaterial information.\n\nRequires the SEC to issue a proposed rule to implement any recommendations it makes to Congress based upon the study."
