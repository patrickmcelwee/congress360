In order to facilitate product listing and performance verification for a sample of products, the EPA may require test data and other product information to be submitted.\n\nThe exemption from third-party certification provided to a program partner will be terminated if the partner is found to have violated program requirements with respect to at least two separate models during a two-year period. The exemption will resume if the partner complies with all program requirements for at least three years."
