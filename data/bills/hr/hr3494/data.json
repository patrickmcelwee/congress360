Under current law, a state plan for medical assistance must provide that any individual eligible for medical assistance may obtain required services from any institution, agency, or person qualified to perform them. The bill specifies that a state may not be required to provide medical assistance for such services by any individual or entity whose services or actions are suspected by the state of causing the termination of a human fetus classified as an infant born alive. Furthermore, a provider of such an abortion may neither receive payment under the Medicaid program nor participate in any federal or state health care program."
