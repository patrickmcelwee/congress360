If an allotment covered by a waiver is also covered by another permit or lease that is not waived, the department must reduce the level of commercial livestock grazing on the allotment to reflect the waiver.\n\nThe departments must not accept more than 100 grazing permits and leases per year, in the aggregate, under this authority."
