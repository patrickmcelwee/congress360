All such transferred functions shall terminate on the date all obligations of the Bank, and all obligations of others to the Bank, in effect immediately before the abolishment date have been satisfied.\n\nThe bill repeals the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 and eliminates related authorizing provisions of various statutes."
