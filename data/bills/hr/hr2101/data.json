This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to ensure that, when appropriate, basic research projects include both male and female cells, tissues, or animals. In such projects, results must be disaggregated according to sex and sex differences must be examined and analyzed. NIH must update guidelines on inclusion of women and minorities in research.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services may support the continued operation and expansion of Special Centers of Research on Sex Differences.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must update the reports entitled \u201cWomen's Health: NIH Has Increased Its Efforts To Include Women in Research\u201d and \u201cWomen's Health: Women Sufficiently Represented in New Drug Testing, But FDA Oversight Needs Improvement,\u201d and include specified examinations."
