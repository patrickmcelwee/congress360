Such strategy shall address efforts to intercept terrorists and foreign fighters and constrain domestic and international travel by such persons.\n\n The President shall direct: (1) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop the initial national strategy, an updated strategy (to be submitted within 180 after the commencement of a new presidential administration), and implementation plans for each national strategy; and (2) other federal agencies to coordinate with DHS in the development and implementation of such strategy and updates.\n\nThe initial national strategy and updates shall:\n\n include an accounting and description of all federal government programs, projects, and activities to constrain travel by terrorists and foreign fighters; identify specific security vulnerabilities within the United States and abroad that may be exploited by such persons; delineate goals for closing those vulnerabilities and enhancing the federal government's ability to constrain such travel; and describe actions and the means needed to achieve such goals. The requirement to transmit: (1) updated national strategies shall terminate 7 years after the date of enactment of this Act, and (2) implementation plans shall terminate 10 years after such date."
