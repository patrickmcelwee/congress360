    "text": "Patient Choice Act of 2015\n\nAmends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to authorize provisional approval of fast track products determined by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to be adequately safe. Treats provisional approval in the same manner as approval of a drug, except that provisional approval is subject to requirements related to informed consent and continued pursuit of safety and efficacy data for purposes of gaining approval for the drug.\n\nDefines the term \u201cadequately safe\u201d to mean that: (1) for at least one population, the risk of death or morbidity of the drug is unlikely to be greater than the combined risks of death or morbidity of the disease and existing therapies; or (2) the drug has had a valid marketing authorization for at least four years in one of the countries specified and data adequate for the approval of that marketing authorization has been submitted to HHS.\n\nProhibits HHS from imposing any requirements for safety studies or data in addition to, or different than, the requirements for studies to establish safety for purposes of Phase 1 (initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans) or Phase 2 (controlled clinical studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication in patients with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug).\n\nApplies the provisional approval only to the indication for which the drug was: (1) designated as a fast track product, and (2) demonstrated to be adequately safe.\n\nPrescribes requirements for termination of provisional approval, withdrawal of provisional approval, and application of market exclusivity to fast-track approval products."
