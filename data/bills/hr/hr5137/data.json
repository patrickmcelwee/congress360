Any number of public housing agencies (PHAs) may participate in the program.\n\nThe plan in a PHA's application to participate shall include criteria for:\n\n a speedy process to determine a tenant's temporary hardship exemption from program requirements; and an informal administrative hearing or grievance process, made public on tenant request, before eviction or termination of assistance. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) shall establish standards for a 10-year participation by all PHAs that have not been designated as troubled during the most recent two fiscal years.\n\nThese PHAs must include in their applications lists of innovative proposals designed to reduce the cost and increase the cost-efficiency of housing, and of innovative ways to assist families and accomplish annual goals.\n\nHUD shall review and process applications to enable the transition to the program of at least 25 PHAs per year, with reserved spots for small and rural PHAs.\n\nEach PHA shall:\n\n submit annually to HUD budget plans meeting specified requirements, and hold as many meetings as necessary to give all assisted families a good-faith opportunity to hear and comment on the budget plan and related PHA reports. HUD shall review annually the activities of each participating PHA and determine its impact, effectiveness, and progress toward meeting program goals.\n\nHUD shall not terminate the program participation of any PHA except in one or more circumstances, including persistent failure to meet the goals identified in its application or failure to cure a material deficiency in performance.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office shall review the program every eight years."
