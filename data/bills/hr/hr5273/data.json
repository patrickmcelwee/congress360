The bill reduces rates for high-cost outlier payments, which are additional Medicare payments made in extraordinarily high-cost cases.\n\n(Sec. 105) The bill reduces the amount by which hospital payment rates for inpatient services increase in FY2018.\n\nTITLE II--PROVISIONS RELATING TO MEDICARE PART B\n\n(Sec. 201) The bill excludes certain off-campus outpatient departments\u00a0(OPDs) from\u00a0specified rules\u00a0that mandate\u00a0lower Medicare payments. Specifically, the exclusion applies to: (1)\u00a0cancer hospitals in off-campus OPDs, and (2) mid-build OPDs.\u00a0A \"mid-build\" OPD is one for which the provider had, before a certain date, a binding written agreement with an outside party for construction.\n\n(Sec. 203) With respect to payment reductions for failing to meet requirements for the meaningful use of electronic health records (EHRs), the bill exempts eligible professionals who are based in ambulatory surgical centers.\n\nTITLE III--OTHER MEDICARE PROVISIONS\n\n(Sec. 301) Until plan year 2019, CMS may not terminate an MA plan solely because the plan failed to achieve a specified minimum quality rating.\n\n(Sec. 302) CMS\u00a0must annually report on Medicare enrollment data, as specified by the bill.\n\n(Sec. 303) CMS\u00a0shall: (1) request information and recommendations from stakeholders on information included in the\u00a0Welcome to Medicare package, and (2)\u00a0update the information included in the\u00a0package accordingly."
