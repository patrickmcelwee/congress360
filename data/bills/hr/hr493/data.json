If Interior fails to act on a permit within a reasonable time (not exceeding one year), the permit is deemed issued.\n\nThis bill amends the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to exempt from criminal liability any taking, killing, or other harm to a migratory bird that is accidental or incidental to the presence or operation of an otherwise lawful activity."
