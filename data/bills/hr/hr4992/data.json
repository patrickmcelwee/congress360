The requirements of this bill shall also apply to foreign financial institutions and registered brokers or dealers in securities if the funds to be transferred are denominated in U.S. dollars.\n\nThe President may not, except for certain humanitarian purposes, issue any license under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act or take other action that permits a domestic or foreign depository institution or registered broker or dealer in securities to conduct an offshore U.S. dollar clearing system, or supply U.S. dollars for any such system conducted or overseen by a foreign government or financial institution, for transactions (including funds transfers) involving or for the benefit of the government of Iran or an Iranian person.\n\n The President may not rescind a preliminary draft rule or final rule authorizing designation of Iran as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern without first certifying to Congress that the government of Iran is no longer engaged in support for terrorism, pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, and any illicit and deceptive financial activities."
