(Sec. 5) The bill amends the Justice Assistance Act of 1984 to require reauthorization after FY2021 of the financial assistance authority under the Emergency Federal Law Enforcement Assistance program.\n\n(Sec. 6) It expands specified grant purposes under the Family-Based Substance Abuse Treatment Program to include prison-based family treatment programs for pregnant women.\n\n(Sec. 7) The Government Accountability Office must study and report to Congress on how DOJ grant programs address the prevention of, treatment for, and recovery from substance use and substance use disorders among adolescents and young adults."
