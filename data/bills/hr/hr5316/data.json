Interior shall establish a science advisory board to furnish analysis and recommendations regarding:\n\n the selection of such eligible entities and activities to receive grants based on the best available science, and appropriate monitoring requirements to quantify project performance and communicate results. Interior shall make grants, through a challenge competition, to eligible entities for projects to carry out innovative approaches to eligible activities.\n\nInterior:\n\n may furnish technical assistance for eligible activities, and shall expand outreach and education respecting carbon sequestration and best practices related to those activities."
