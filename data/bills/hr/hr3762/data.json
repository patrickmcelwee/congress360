(Sec. 207) This bill amends part A (General Provisions) of title XI of the Social Security Act (SSAct) to require the additional payments to U.S. territories for Medicaid under the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 to be made by the end of FY2017 instead of the end of FY2019.\n\nThis bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the SSAct to end the expansion of Medicaid under PPACA on December 31, 2017.\n\nAfter 2017, hospitals may no longer elect to provide Medicaid services to individuals during a presumptive eligibility period.\n\nStates must maintain Medicaid eligibility standards for individuals under 19 years old through FY2017 instead of through FY2019.\n\nThe federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP, the federal matching rate for Medicaid expenditures) for U.S. territories is 50% after 2017 (currently, the FMAP is 55%).\n\nThe increased FMAP for childless adults and home and community-based attendant services under PPACA ends December 31, 2017.\n\nAfter 2017, states may no longer elect to provide certain individuals with a presumptive eligibility period for Medicaid.\n\nMedicaid benchmark plans are no longer required to provide minimum essential health benefits after 2017.\n\nAfter 2017, states are no longer required to operate a website for Medicaid enrollment that is linked to the state's health benefit exchange and Children's Health Insurance program (CHIP).\n\n(Sec. 208) Medicaid allotments for disproportionate share hospitals are increased.\n\n(Sec. 209) The excise tax on high cost employer-sponsored health coverage (popularly known as the \"Cadillac tax\") does not apply after 2017.\n\n(Sec. 210) Health savings accounts (HSAs), Archer medical savings accounts (MSAs), health flexible spending arrangements (HFSAs), and health reimbursement arrangements may be used to pay for over-the-counter medications.\n\n(Sec. 211) This bill lowers the tax on distributions from HSAs and Archer MSAs that are not used for medical expenses.\n\n(Sec. 212) Salary reduction contributions to an HFSA under a cafeteria plan are no longer limited.\n\n(Sec. 213) The annual fee on manufacturers and importers of brand name prescription drugs is eliminated.\n\n(Sec. 214) The excise tax on medical devices is eliminated.\n\n(Sec. 215) The annual fee on health insurers is eliminated.\n\n(Sec. 216) Medical costs are allowed as a tax deduction regardless of whether the costs are taken into account when determining the amount of the subsidy for an employer-sponsored retiree prescription drug plan under Medicare part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program).\n\n(Sec. 217) A tax deduction is allowed for medical expenses in excess of 7.5% (currently, 10%) of adjusted gross income.\n\n(Sec. 218) The additional Medicare tax on income above a certain threshold is eliminated.\n\n(Sec. 219) The indoor tanning services tax is eliminated.\n\n(Sec. 220) The net investment income tax is eliminated.\n\n(Sec. 221) A health insurer is allowed a tax deduction for the full amount of an employee's compensation.
