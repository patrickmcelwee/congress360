Requires the Administration to identify ongoing successful adult day programs and which of these serve young adults with neurological diseases and conditions and develop best practices to help guide the establishment of additional successful adult day programs.\n\nDirects the Administration to establish a competitive grant program to fund adult day programs serving younger people with neurological diseases or conditions. Defines an \"adult day program\" as a program that provides comprehensive and effective care and support services to individuals living with neurological diseases or conditions and to their family caregivers and that may assist participants in ways that: (1) maintain or improve their functional abilities or otherwise help them adjust to their changing functional abilities; (2) prevent the onset of complications associated with severe forms of the disease or condition; (3) promote alternatives to placement in nursing homes; (4) reduce the strain on family caregivers taking care of a family member living with neurological diseases or conditions; (5) focus on supporting the emotional, social, and intellectual needs of a younger adult population; or (6) address the needs of veterans living with neurological diseases or conditions."
