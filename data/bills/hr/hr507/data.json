Repeals the requirement of service before enactment of such Act. Allows Members to opt out of FERS benefits regardless of when they have been elected.\n\nAmends the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) Agency Contributions requirements to permit a Member of Congress to elect irrevocably, by written notice to the official by whom such Member is paid, not to receive TSP contributions."
