Directs the CBP Commissioner to prescribe related regulations.\n\nSubjects an importer who fails to provide or files a false declaration to certain penalties. Requires the Department of Agriculture and the FDA jointly to study the feasibility and advisability of requiring foreign producers of food distributed in commerce to establish a registered agent in the United States who is authorized to accept service of process on behalf of such producers for the purpose of all civil and regulatory actions in state and federal courts.\n\nRequires the head of each agency cited in this Act similarly to study feasible and advisable methods of requiring foreign manufacturers or producers of component parts of covered products distributed in U.S. commerce to establish registered agents in the United States for purposes of such service of process."
