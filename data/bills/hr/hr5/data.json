    "text": "Student Success Act\n\n(Sec. 6) Reauthorizes through FY2019 the programs under titles I-IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended by this Act.\n\n(Sec. 7) Expresses the sense of Congress that states and local educational agencies (LEAs) retain the rights and responsibilities of determining educational curricula, programs of instruction, and assessments.\n\nTITLE I--AID TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES\n\nSubtitle A--In General\n\n(Sec. 101) Replaces title I (Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged) of the ESEA with a new title I (Aid to Local Educational Agencies) composed of parts A (Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged), B (National Assessment), and C (General Provisions).\n\n(Sec. 103) Gives states and LEAs flexibility in transferring funds among the programs under part A of title I. (This Act consolidates programs under part A of title I that are currently located in different parts of title I and in titles III, VI, and VII of the ESEA.)\n\n(Sec. 104) Increases, from 4% to 7%, the percentage of school improvement funds (allocated by this Act to states under a new subpart 1 of part A of title I) that are to be set aside for reallocation to LEAs to carry out the state's system of school improvement.\n\n(Sec. 105) Requires states to set aside 3% of their allocation of school improvement funds for a Direct Student Services program awarding grants to LEAs to cover high quality academic tutoring services or the transportation costs students incur in exercising public school choice.\n\nSubtitle B--Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged\n\n(Sec. 111) Amends the education accountability requirements under part A of title I of the ESEA and places them in a new subpart 1 (Improving Basic Programs Operated by Local Educational Agencies) under part A (Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged) of title I of the ESEA.\n\n(Sec. 112) Maintains the requirement conditioning a state's receipt of school improvement funds on states developing and implementing academic content and achievement standards that are applicable to all public schools and public school students in the state.\n\nRequires those academic content and achievement standards to cover mathematics, reading or language arts, and science and to ensure that all public school students graduate from high school fully prepared for postsecondary education or the workforce.\n\nAllows states to adopt standards in any other subject.\n\nRequires states to implement a set of high-quality assessments of student progress toward those standards that measure the overall performance of students in each public school and the performance of their poor, minority, disabled, and English learner subgroups. Requires such assessments to enable results to be disaggregated within each state, LEA, and school to indicate the performance of students within various specified subgroups. Eliminates the requirement that student performance be judged as basic, proficient, or advanced.\n\nRequires the assessments in mathematics and reading or language arts to be administered in each of grades 3 through 8 and at least once in grades 9 through 12.\n\nRequires the assessments in mathematics, reading or language arts, and science to: (1) measure individual student academic proficiency and, at the state's discretion, growth; (2) be administered through a single annual summative assessment or multiple assessments during an academic year; and (3) include measures that assess higher-order thinking skills and understanding.\n\nAllows states to develop and administer computer adaptive assessments that measure student proficiency against, and growth toward, the standards for the student's grade level.\n\nAllows states to adopt alternate academic achievement standards and assessments for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities.\n\nRequires states to establish English language proficiency standards that are aligned with their academic content standards in reading or language arts. Requires the annual assessment of the English proficiency of English learners (currently referred to as \"limited English proficient students\") to be aligned with the English language proficiency standards.\n\nEliminates the requirement that LEAs and schools make adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward state academic performance standards or be subject to specified improvements, corrective action, or restructuring.\n\nRequires, instead, that each state accountability system: (1) use the state's academic achievement standards and assessments in mathematics and reading or language arts to evaluate the academic performance of each public school on an annual basis, and (2) require LEAs to implement interventions that address the weaknesses in each low-performing school.\n\nGives states two years after this Act's enactment to adopt and implement their academic standards, assessments, and accountability system.\n\nProhibits this Act from being construed as affecting state laws granting parents authority over schools that repeatedly failed to make AYP.\n\nMaintains the requirement that states and LEAs prepare and disseminate an annual report card regarding the performance of their students and schools, but adapts it to this Act's accountability provisions.\n\nRequires states to report, for each of their public high schools, in the aggregate and disaggregated by student subgroup: (1) the school's four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate; and (2) if applicable, the school's extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate, reported separately for students graduating in five years or less, six years or less, and seven or more years.\n\nProhibits the Department of Education (ED) from, directly or indirectly, attempting to influence or coerce state: (1) adoption of the Common Core State Standards, any other standards common to a significant number of states, or assessments tied to such standards; or (2) participation in any voluntary partnership with another state to develop and implement academic assessments and standards.\n\n(Sec. 115) Amends schoolwide programs that allow LEAs to consolidate school improvement funds to upgrade the entire educational program of schools, to eliminate the requirement that such schools serve a high proportion of low-income families.\n\nAllows the delivery of schoolwide reform strategies by nonprofit and for-profit external providers that have expertise in using effective strategies to improve student achievement.\n\n(Sec. 116) Allows the elements of Targeted Assistance programs, which direct school improvement funds toward the children in a school that are failing or most at risk of failing, to be delivered by nonprofit and for-profit external providers that have expertise in using effective strategies to improve student achievement.\n\n(Sec. 117) Eliminates the School Support and Recognition program.\n\n(Sec. 119) Repeals provisions that established deadlines by which teachers in basic programs operated by LEAs must be highly qualified.\n\n(Sec. 120) Requires states to designate an ombudsman to ensure that private school children receive educational services and benefits that are equitable to those received by public school children under subpart 1.\n\nDirects states, rather than LEAs, to provide or arrange for the provision of such services and benefits to private schools in certain circumstances.\n\n(Sec. 124) Reserves 91.44% of the amounts authorized to be appropriated under subpart 1 of part A of title I for the Improving Basic Programs Operated by Local Educational Agencies program.\n\n(Sec. 126) Alters the percentages and numbers used in the formula allocating targeted grant funds to LEAs and makes those changes applicable beginning in FY2022 only if ED certifies that those changes will not harm any school district.\n\n(Sec. 128) Alters the percentages and numbers used in the formula allocating education finance incentive grant funds to LEAs and makes those changes applicable beginning in FY2022 only if ED certifies that those changes will not harm any school district.\n\n(Sec. 129) Authorizes states, to the extent permitted by state law, to allocate title I grant funds among their LEAs on the basis of the number of impoverished children enrolled in the public schools served by each LEA.\n\nSubtitle C--Additional Aid to States and School Districts\n\n(Sec. 131) Strikes parts B (Student Reading Skills Improvement Grants), F (Comprehensive School Reform), G (Advanced Placement Programs), and H (School Dropout Prevention) of title I of the ESEA.\n\nAmends part C of the current title I and transfers it to a new subpart 2 (Education of Migratory Children) under part A of title I of the ESEA.\n\nAlters the formula for allocating subpart 2 funds to states. Counts each state's: (1) average number of eligible full-time equivalent migratory children from the previous three years, and (2) number of migratory children who received services under summer or intercession programs the previous year.\n\nEliminates the program awarding competitive incentive grants to states that enter into a consortium with another state or entity that ED determines will improve the delivery of services to migratory children whose education is interrupted.\n\nReserves 2.45% of the amounts authorized to be appropriated under subpart 2 of part A of title I for the Education of Migratory Children program .\n\nAmends part D of the current title I and transfers it to a new subpart 3 (Prevention and Intervention Programs for Children and Youth who are Neglected, Delinquent, or At-Risk) under part A of title I of the ESEA.\n\nRequires states to place a priority on children in the program obtaining a regular high school diploma, if feasible.\n\nReserves 0.31% of the amounts authorized to be appropriated under subpart 3 of part A of title I for Prevention and Intervention Programs for Children and Youth who are Neglected, Delinquent, or At-Risk.\n\nAmends part A of title III (Language Instruction for Limited English Proficient and Immigrant Students) and transfers it to a new subpart 4 (English Language Acquisition, Language Enhancement, and Academic Achievement) under part A of title I of the ESEA. (The program provides grants to states and, through them, grants to LEAs to improve the education of English learners.)\n\nChanges the current references to \"limited English proficient students\" to \"English learners.\"\n\nDirects ED, for the purpose of determining each state's allotment, to determine the number of English learners in each state using: (1) data from the American Community Survey, conducted by the Department of Commerce; or (2) the number of students being assessed by the state for English language proficiency. Requires the number of immigrant youth in each state to be determined using data from that survey.\n\nRemoves English language proficiency standards requirements, which are now covered in subpart 1 of part A of title I. Requires the states to report to ED, and ED to report to Congress, annually, rather than biennially, on the effectiveness of the grant program in improving the education of English learners.\n\nIncludes public or private organizations with the experience and capacity to improve instruction for English learners as eligible grant recipients under the National Professional Development Project. Allows those grants to be used to disseminate effective practices in teaching English learners and to increase parent and community engagement in their education.\n\nEliminates the Improving Language Instruction Educational programs under part B of title III.\n\nTransfers requirements for the National Clearinghouse for English Language Acquisition and\n\nLanguage Instruction Educational Programs under part C of title III to subpart 4 under part A of title I of the ESEA.\n\nReserves 4.6% of the amounts authorized to be appropriated under subpart 4 of part A of title I for the English Language Acquisition, Language Enhancement, and Academic Achievement program.\n\nAmends part B (Rural Education Initiative) of title VI (Flexibility and Accountability) and transfers it to a new subpart 5 (Rural Education Achievement Program) under part A of title I of the ESEA.\n\nDirects ED to reserve: (1) 0.6% of the amounts authorized to be appropriated under part A of title I to award grants to rural LEAs under the Small, Rural School Achievement (SRSA) program; and (2) 0.6% to award grants to states and, through them, rural LEAs under the Rural and Low-Income School (RLIS) program.\n\nRequires grant funds under both programs to be used for activities authorized under Part A of title I, title II, and title III of the ESEA.\n\nUpdates the locale codes used in determining whether schools are in a rural area.\n\nProhibits LEAs that are eligible to participate in the SRSA and RLIS programs from receiving funds under both programs.\n\nSubtitle D--National Assessment\n\n(Sec. 141) Amends part E (National Assessment) of title I and transfers it to a new part B of title I of the ESEA.\n\nRepeals the Demonstrations of Innovative Practices grant program and the Close Up Fellowship program.\n\nRequires ED, acting through the Director of the Institute of Education Sciences (Director), to conduct a national assessment of the success of the title I programs in helping all students graduate from high school prepared for postsecondary education or the workforce.\n\nTransfers to the Director responsibility for carrying out: (1) the longitudinal study of schools receiving school improvement funds under subpart 1 of part A, and (2) the independent study of the assessments used for state accountability purposes.\n\nSubtitle E--Title I General Provisions\n\n(Sec. 151) Amends part I (General Provisions) of title I and transfers it to a new part C of title I of the ESEA.\n\nSets forth the rulemaking procedure ED is to follow if a negotiated rulemaking process under title I is unnecessary or the individuals chosen to participate in the process fail to reach unanimous agreement.\n\nRequires each state to identify any duplicative or conflicting requirements between state and federal rules or regulations, eliminate those state rules or regulations that are duplicative, and resolve conflicts.\n\nRequires public charter school leaders and representatives of public charter school authorizers to be included on each state's committee of practitioners that advises the state on carrying out its responsibilities under title I.\n\nProhibits this Act from being construed to alter the rights afforded to school or LEA employees under collective bargaining agreements or other agreements between such employees and their employers.\n\nTITLE II--TEACHER PREPARATION AND EFFECTIVENESS\n\n(Sec. 201) Replaces title II (Preparing, Training, and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals) of the ESEA with a new title II (Teacher Preparation and Effectiveness).\n\nDirects ED, under part A (Supporting Effective Instruction) of title II, to make formula\n\ngrants to states and, through them, subgrants to LEAs that LEAs may use to:\n\n develop and implement a teacher evaluation system; implement a statewide teacher evaluation system if their state is implementing one; train school leaders or other individuals to evaluate teachers or school leaders; implement a statewide school leader evaluation system if their state is implementing one; develop and implement a school leader evaluation system if a statewide system is not being implemented; provide training to teachers and school leaders that is evidence-based, job-embedded, and continuous; partner with public or private organizations to develop and implement the teacher evaluation system or administer professional development; carry out activities under part B of title II; or reduce class size, though they are not to use more than 10% of the subgrant to do so. Provides that a teacher evaluation system developed and implemented by an LEA may: (1) use student achievement data derived from a variety of sources as a significant factor in determining a teacher's evaluation, with the weight given to such data defined by the LEA; (2) use multiple measures of evaluation; (3) use more than two categories for rating teachers; (4) be used by the LEA to make personnel decisions; and (5) be based on input from parents and school staff.\n\nAllocates part A grants to states and, through them, subgrants to LEAs pursuant to a formula that apportions: (1) 50% of the funding to states and LEAs on the basis of their share of students aged 5-17 on the national and state level, respectively; and (2) 50% of such funding on the basis of their share of impoverished students in that age group.\n\nAlters such formula for allotting funds to states for any fiscal year in which the amount allotted to LEAs that serve a high percentage of impoverished children falls below the amount allotted to such LEAs for FY2015.\n\nRequires states to use 95% of their part A grant for subgrants to LEAs, with the remainder being used for specified state activities that include the provision of technical assistance and training to LEAs.\n\nRequires ED to reserve 75% of title II appropriations for the part A program.\n\nRequires LEAs that are implementing a teacher or school leader evaluation system to report annually to their state the results of such evaluation system.\n\nDirects ED, under part B (Teacher and School Leader Flexible Grant) of title II, to make formula grants to states and, through them, competitive matching subgrants to LEAs, institutions of higher education, and business or nonprofit entities to develop, implement, and evaluate comprehensive programs and activities that may include:\n\n initiatives to assist in recruiting, hiring, and retaining highly effective teachers and school leaders; support for the establishment or expansion of teacher or school leader preparation academies; the recruitment of qualified individuals from other fields; model instructional programs; evidence-based, job embedded, continuous professional development for teachers and school leaders; programs that are based on the current science of learning; and recruitment and training of teachers to teach dual credit, dual enrollment, Advanced Placement, or International Baccalaureate postsecondary-level courses to secondary school students. Allots part B grants to states based on their proportion of the country's school-age population.\n\nRequires states to use at least 92% of their part B grant for subgrants to LEAs.\n\nRequires states to reserve up to 4% of their part B grant for innovative teacher and school leader activities that include: (1) certification, recertification, licensing, and tenure system reforms; (2) alternative routes for state certification or licensure; (3) pay incentives; and (4) induction, mentoring, and training programs.\n\nAllows state to reserve up to 3% of their part B grant to support: (1) the establishment or expansion of teacher or school leader preparation academies; and (2) state authorizers for such academies.\n\nRequires the state to evaluate periodically the effectiveness of those academies and part B subgrantees.\n\nRequires ED to reserve 25% of title II appropriations for the part B program.\n\nDirects ED to: (1) provide technical assistance to states and subgrantees in carrying out activities under parts A and B of title II, and (2) conduct national evaluations of those activities through the Institute of Education Sciences.\n\nPreserves the teacher liability protection provisions under part C (Innovation for Teacher Quality) of title II, but eliminates the other programs under part C.\n\nReplaces part D (Enhancing Education through Technology) of title II with a new part D (General Provisions).\n\nTreats charter schools as LEAs under title II.\n\nRequires LEAs receiving grants under title II to notify parents, at the beginning of each school year, of the availability of the results of the evaluations of their children's teachers.\n\nRequires state applications for part A grants to include specified information with respect to policies and procedures regarding background checks for school employees and contractors.\n\nMakes a state or LEA ineligible for ESEA funds if it knowingly facilitates the transfer of an employee that it knows or has probable cause to believe has engaged in sexual misconduct with a student.\n\nTITLE III--PARENTAL ENGAGEMENT AND LOCAL FLEXIBILITY\n\n(Sec. 301) Replaces title III (Language Instruction for Limited English Proficient and Immigrant Students) of the ESEA with a new title III (Parental Engagement and Local Flexibility).\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that charter schools are a critical part of the education system and that the opening of more quality charter schools must be supported.\n\nAmends subparts 1 (Charter School Programs) and 2 (Credit Enhancement Initiatives to Assist Charter School Facility Acquisition, Construction, and Renovation) of part B of title V (Promoting Informed Parental Choice and Innovative Programs) and moves them to a new subpart 1 (Charter School Program) under part A (Parental Engagement) of title III.\n\nReplaces the current charter school grant program with a program awarding grants to state entities (state educational agencies, state charter school boards, governors, or charter school support organizations) and, through them, subgrants to charter school developers to open new charter schools and expand and replicate high-quality charter schools.\n\nRequires grantees to use at least 7% of the grant funds to: (1) provide technical assistance to subgrantees and authorized public chartering agencies, and (2) work with those agencies to improve the charter school authorization process.\n\nProhibits grantees from reserving more than 3% of the grant funds for administrative costs.\n\nDirects the Comptroller General (GAO) to submit a report to ED and Congress, within three years of this Act's enactment, examining the appropriateness of that level of authorized funding for administrative costs.\n\nLimits the duration of charter school grants and subgrants to no more than five years. Gives subgrantees no more than 18 months to plan and design their programs.\n\nProhibits ED from awarding a charter school grant to a state entity if such award would result in more than one charter school grant being carried out in a state at the same time. Limits subgrantees to no more than one subgrant per charter school over a five-year period, unless the subgrantee demonstrates at least three years of improved educational results for students enrolled in the applicable charter school.\n\nRequires ED and each grantee to use a peer review process to review applications for charter school grants and subgrants.\n\nRequires grantees to award subgrants in a manner that ensures that subgrants: (1) are distributed to different areas, and (2) assist charter schools representing a variety of educational approaches.\n\nPermits ED to waive certain statutory or regulatory requirements if the waiver is requested by a grant applicant and promotes the purpose of the Charter School program without tampering with what is definitionally required of charter schools.\n\nDirects ED to give priority to grant applicants to the extent that they are from states that:\n\n have a quality authorized public chartering agency that is not an LEA, if the state allows entities other than LEAs to be authorized public chartering agencies; have an appeals process for the denial of a charter school application, if LEAs are the only authorized public chartering agencies; do not impose any limitation on the number or percentage of charter schools that may exist or the number or percentage of students that may attend charter schools; ensure equitable financing, as compared to traditional public schools, for charter schools and students in a prompt manner; and use charter schools and best practices from charter schools to help improve struggling schools and LEAs. Directs ED to give priority to grant applicants also to the extent that they:\n\n partner with an organization experienced in developing management organizations to support charter school development, support charter schools that support at-risk students, authorize all their charter schools to serve as school food authorities, take steps to ensure that all authorizing public chartering agencies implement best practices for charter school authorizing, and demonstrate that their state provides charter schools with specified assistance in acquiring or accessing charter school facilities.
