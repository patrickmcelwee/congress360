NOAA and the NWS shall develop and disseminate landslide-related curricula and training modules for state and local officials and emergency managers.\n\nThe bill establishes an Interagency Coordinating Committee on Landslides, chaired by the USGS Director, which shall:\n\n oversee the planning, management, and coordination of the program; develop and periodically update a strategic plan and a detailed management plan for the program; and develop a coordinated interagency budget for such program. The Director shall establish an Advisory Committee on Landslides, which may submit recommendations to the coordinating committee.\n\nThe Secretary of the Interior shall: (1) make grants, administered through the USGS, to support state and local government efforts to map and assess landslide hazards; and (2) make grants to support efforts by institutions of higher education, state and local governments, and nongovernmental entities to research landslides."
