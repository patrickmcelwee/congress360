The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nPresidential Allowance Modernization Act\n\n(Sec 2) Allows each former U.S. President a lifetime annual annuity of $200,000 and an annual monetary allowance of $200,000, each adjusted annually for inflation as provided by the Social Security Act. Reduces such annual allowance by the amount that a President's adjusted gross income in a taxable year exceeds $400,000. Denies such annuity and monetary allowance to a former President who holds an appointive or elective position in or under the federal government that pays more than a nominal amount.\n\nIncreases from $20,000 to $100,000 the annual annuity of a surviving spouse of a former President, with an annual inflation adjustment to such increased amount as provided by the Social Security Act.\n\n(Sec. 3) Declares that nothing in this Act shall be considered to affect: (1) any provision of law relating to the security or protection of a former President or a family member of the President, or (2) funding to carry out security or protection of the former President.\n\n(Sec. 4) Makes this Act applicable to any individual who is a former President or the widow of a former President as of the date of enactment."
