Qualifies those properties for such rates.\n\nRequires FEMA, when developing guidance and rate tables necessary to implement this Act, to consult with Write Your Own companies, which are participating property and casualty insurance companies that write and service standard flood insurance policies in cooperation with FEMA.\n\nDirects Write Your Own companies to implement the changes required by the final guidance and rate tables within six to eight months after their issuance."
