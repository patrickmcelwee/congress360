Requires such training to include:\n\n methods for identifying suspected victims and perpetrators of human trafficking, methods for approaching a suspected victim in a manner that is sensitive to the victim and not likely to alert a perpetrator, training that is most appropriate for a particular location or environment, and a post-training evaluation of trainees. (Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary: (1) to reassess the training program annually; (2) within one year after enactment of this Act, to certify to the appropriate congressional committees that all such personnel have successfully completed the required training; and (3) to report annually on the overall effectiveness of the training program and on the number of human trafficking cases reported by DHS personnel and the number confirmed.\n\n(Sec. 5) Authorizes the Secretary, upon request, to provide training curricula to assist any state, local, or tribal government or private organization in establishing its program."
