Requires the Bureau to provide the data to Congress and make it available to the public. Restricts the disclosure of the name or identifying information of a law enforcement officer, a person who was the target of deadly force, or any other individual involved in any activity for which such data is collected.\n\nDirects the Attorney General to reduce by 10% the amount that would otherwise be awarded under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program to a state or local government that fails to comply with the requirements of this Act."
