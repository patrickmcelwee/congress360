NOAA may take appropriate actions to respond to the emergency, including making grants, entering into contracts, and investigating the cause, treatment, or prevention of the emergency.\n\nUpon declaring an emergency, NOAA must: (1) designate an individual to coordinate the response to the emergency, (2) develop a response plan within 28 days of the declaration, and (3) publish a summary of the plan within 21 days of the declaration.\n\nThe emergency terminates when NOAA declares that the emergency no longer exists or 120 days after the declaration was made, whichever occurs first. NOAA may renew a declaration.\n\nThe Marine Disease Emergency Working Group is established in NOAA to provide advice on assessing, declaring, and responding to emergencies.\n\nThe Marine Disease Emergency Fund is established to respond to emergencies.\n\nNOAA must establish a National Data Repository for Marine Diseases Research and Services to collect, store, and disseminate information on marine diseases and facilitate the development and rapid dissemination of research.\n\nSea star wasting syndrome is deemed to be a marine disease emergency."
