Sets forth FIPC corporate structure.\n\nRequires FIPC to: (1) establish, and make deposits into and payments from a FIPC fund in the same manner in which SIPC has established and is authorized to make deposits into and payments from the SIPC fund; and (2) impose upon its membership assessments subject to the same rules that apply to imposition of assessments upon SIPC members.\n\nAmends the Commodity Exchange Act to prescribe suitability rules governing a futures commission merchant's recommendations for a customer.\n\nGrants the CFTC enforcement powers.\n\nDirects the CFTC to review specified guidelines governing establishing account classes and determining the basis for pro rata shares (proof of claims guidelines)."
