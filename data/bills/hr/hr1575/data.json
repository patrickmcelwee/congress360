(Currently, such program is required as a pilot program under the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010.)\n\n Such services shall include:\n\n information on family, employment, and community reintegration; financial and occupational counseling; and information and counseling on stress reduction and conflict resolution."
