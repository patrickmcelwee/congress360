This fund operates in a manner similar to the Thrift Savings Fund, which is available to federal employees.\n\nThe bill establishes an American Savings Account Board of Directors to establish policies for fund investment and management. The board shall select or establish a list of investment funds and options similar to those in the Thrift Savings Fund, among which participants may choose.\n\nThe board shall establish an American Savings Account Fund Advisory Council to advise the board on matters relating to investment policies.\n\nThe American Savings Account Fund is tax-exempt and contributions to, or distributions from, it are excludible from gross income."
