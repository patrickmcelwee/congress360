The bill prescribes a civil monetary penalty of up to $5,000 per day for violation of this prohibition.\n\nThe Department of Justice shall award grants to state and local governments to carry out activities to remove, redact, or truncate, in accordance with the uniform standards, all Social Security account numbers on forms and records of their executive, legislative, and judicial agencies that would be displayed to the general public on the Internet in violation of this Act."
