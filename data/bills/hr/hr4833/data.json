States may only make loans for qualified grocery stores that:\n\n emphasize unprocessed, healthful foods; provide staple foods and a variety of raw fruits and vegetables; have a plan to keep the foods in stock; and charge prices at or below municipal averages. States must prioritize loan applications from entities that meet criteria, including:\n\n hiring workers from the underserved community, providing classes or educational information about a healthful diet, sourcing food from local urban farms and gardens, not selling alcohol or tobacco products, or demonstrating existing supply chain relationships or expertise in the grocery industry."
