A recipient also must establish a peer review group to give expert advice on the scientific, technical, and project management aspects of the project. Each peer review group must:\n\n meet annually until the project is completed; review the project within 90 days after any significant change in its scope, schedule, or budget; and report on the findings of each review to DOT, Congress, and the recipient. Each recipient must publish such report on its website, along with the name, license number, and license type of each engineer supervising an aspect of the project."
