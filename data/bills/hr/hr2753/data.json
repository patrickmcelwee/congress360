Bars the ATF from editing or erasing any such recording.\n\nDirects the ATF to make available a digital video disc that contains a copy of the recording: (1) at the request of a person who claims an ownership interest in such item, and (2) to a defendant in a criminal proceeding involving such item. Provides that an item which the ATF has determined is a firearm or ammunition shall not be admissible as evidence unless: (1) the ATF has complied with the requirements of this Act to make its digital video disc available, or (2) such compliance has been waived in writing by the person against whom the item is offered as evidence."
