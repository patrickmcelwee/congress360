Requires each program to provide materials that:\n\n contain information that is peer-reviewed, balanced, accurate, and up-to-date; enable the respective target audience to understand the available options with regard to such screenings, other prenatal screenings, and diagnostic tests; promote the informed consent of, and enhance the decision-making processes of, the respective target audience before and after such screenings; contain information that appropriately addresses the diversity of the patient population; and contain contact information for relevant services and support organizations for patients. Requires CDC to submit annual reports regarding:\n\n the development and implementation of such programs; the accessibility of each program to, and the adoption of each program by, its respective target audience; and CDC's efforts to ensure that providers and patients receive the materials created pursuant to this Act."
