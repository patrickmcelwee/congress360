Exempts from such requirements: (1) the spouse, or the dependents, without a social security number of a taxpayer who is a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, and (2) nonresident aliens claiming tax treaty benefits.\n\nRequires the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration to audit, on a biennial basis, the IRS program for issuance of ITINs pursuant to this Act and report to Congress on such audit."
