A \"qualified vehicle\" is:\n\n a vehicle that operates on natural gas, hydrogen, or biodiesel; a flexible fuel vehicle capable of operating on gasoline, E85, and M85; a plug-in electric drive vehicle; or a vehicle propelled solely by fuel cell or by something other than an internal combustion engine. The bill authorizes a manufacturer to request an exemption from such requirement from the Department of Transportation."
