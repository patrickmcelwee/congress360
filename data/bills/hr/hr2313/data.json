Requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to ensure that the System facilitates further research on hydrocephalus.\n\nRequires HHS to provide for the collection and storage of information on hydrocephalus, including the incidence, prevalence, and other information, to the extent practicable.\n\nRequires HHS to: (1) make information and analysis in the System available to the public, including researchers; and (2) ensure that privacy and security protections applicable to the System are at least as stringent as the protections under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act."
