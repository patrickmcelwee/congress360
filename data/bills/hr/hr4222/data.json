Russell National School Lunch Act.\n\nED: (1) shall deposit into each account for a selected student an initial amount equal to the amount of the maximum federal Pell Grant for the award year, and (2) may make additional deposits of such amount based on the student's academic progress.\n\nA student may use funds from such account only to pay the cost of attendance at a qualified institution. Any contribution to or distribution from such account shall not be includible in gross income. The amount of any Pell Grant awarded to a student attending a qualified institution shall be reduced by the amount in such student's account.\n\nED shall: (1) monitor the academic progress of each student for whose benefit an account is maintained; and (2) ensure that each such student receives at least 12 hours of financial counseling on the rules pertaining to deposits, distributions, and the tax treatment of funds in the account and on sources of federal financial assistance for higher education."
