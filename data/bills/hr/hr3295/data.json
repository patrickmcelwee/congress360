Provides that the funds are only available if the President subsequently designates the amounts. (Emergency spending is exempt from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules.)\n\nProvides appropriations to DOJ for: the Office of Justice Programs, including State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance and Juvenile Justice Programs; and Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS).\n\nProvides appropriations to the SBA for Entrepreneurial Development Programs and the Business Loans Program Account.\n\nProvides appropriations to Labor for the Employment and Training Administration.\n\nProvides appropriations to HHS for the Health Resources and Services Administration and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nProvides appropriations to HUD for Public and Indian Housing, Community Planning and Development, and the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes.\n\nRequires HUD to extend current Moving to Work agreements of previously designated participating agencies until the end of FY2028, subject to specified requirements and restrictions. (Moving to Work is a demonstration program that provides HUD and local Public Housing Authorities flexibility to test alternative policies for providing housing assistance through the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program and the public housing program.)"
