    "text": "Together We Care Act of 2015\n\n This bill amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to direct the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to establish a pilot program to make grants on a competitive basis to eligible entities for the training of public housing residents as home health aides and providers of home-based health services to enable them to provide covered home-based health services (services for which medical assistance is available under a state Medicaid plan or for which financial assistance is available under this Act) to residents of:\n\n public housing who are elderly, disabled, or both; and federally-assisted rental housing who are elderly, disabled, or both, subject to HUD criteria. The grants may be used:\n\n to establish a program to train public housing residents to provide covered home-based health care services to elderly and disabled public housing residents and to elderly and disabled residents of federally-assisted rental housing, for the transportation and child care expenses of public housing residents in training, and for the administrative expenses of carrying out such a program. For any resident of public housing who is trained as a home health aide or as a provider of home-based health services under the program, any income received for providing covered home-based health services shall apply towards eligibility for benefits under federal housing programs as specified in this Act, based on length of time following completion of the training."
