The rate of such credit is modified to equal the sum of 20% of so much of the qualified research expenses for the taxable year as exceeds 50% of the average qualified research expenses for the three preceding taxable years, 20% of so much of the basic research payments for the taxable year as exceeds 50% of the average basic research payments for the three preceding taxable years, plus 20% of amounts paid by a business taxpayer to an energy research consortium for energy research. If a taxpayer has no qualified research expenses in any of the three preceding taxable years, the rate of the tax credit is reduced to 10% of current research expenses.\n\nThe bill also provides that in the case of an eligible small business (i.e., a corporation whose stock is not publicly traded, a partnership, or a sole proprietorship with annual gross receipts not exceeding $50 million in a three-year period), the research credit may offset alternative minimum tax liability.\n\n(Sec. 3) The bill prohibits the entry of the budgetary effects of this Act on either PAYCO scorecard under the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010."
