The standard must require the use of engineering and safety controls to handle patients.\n\nThe standard must require health care employers to: (1) develop and implement a safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention program; (2) train their workers on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention; and (3) post a notice that explains the standard, procedures to report patient handling-related injuries, and workers' rights under this Act. Labor must conduct unscheduled inspections to ensure compliance with the standard.\n\nThis bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to apply the standard to hospitals receiving Medicare funds."
