If Interior collects amounts from the Post in advance of incurring the actual costs, it shall refund to the Post any amount in excess of those costs.\n\nLand and interests acquired by the United States by this Act shall be administered as part of the Gulf Islands National Seashore.\n\nInterior shall modify the boundaries of the Gulf Islands National Seashore to reflect such land exchange upon its completion."
