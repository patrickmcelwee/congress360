DOT, in developing such standards, shall:\n\n consider the economic impacts of the regulations on individual gas customers, ensure that the regulations do not have a significant economic impact on end users, and consider existing consensus standards. A user fee shall be imposed on an entity operating an underground natural gas storage facility. Collected fees shall be deposited in an underground natural gas storage facility safety account, which shall be established in the Pipeline Safety Fund and which shall be made available only for activities related to natural gas storage safety."
