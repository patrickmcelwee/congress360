The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nOcmulgee Mounds National Historical Park Boundary Revision Act of 2016\n\n(Sec. 3) This bill redesignates the Ocmulgee National Monument in Georgia as the Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park. (Sec. 4) The boundary of the Historical Park is adjusted to include approximately 2,100 acres.\n\n(Sec. 5) The Department of the Interior may acquire lands and interests within the boundaries of the Historical Park by donation or exchange only (and in the case of an exchange, no payment may be made by Interior to any landowner). Interior may not, however, acquire any land or interest within such boundaries by condemnation. Furthermore, no private property or non-federal public property shall be included within those boundaries without the owner's written consent.\n\nNothing in this Act or in the establishment or management of the Historical Park shall be construed to create buffer zones outside the Historical Park.\n\n(Sec. 6) Interior shall administer any acquired land as part of the Historical Park.\n\n (Sec. 7) Interior shall conduct a special resource study of the Ocmulgee River corridor between the cities of Macon, Georgia, and Hawkinsville, Georgia, to determine:\n\n the national significance of the study area; the suitability and feasibility of adding lands in the study area to the National Park System; and the methods and means for the protection and interpretation of the study area by the National Park Service, other federal, state, local government entities, affiliated federally recognized Indian tribes, or private or nonprofit organizations."
