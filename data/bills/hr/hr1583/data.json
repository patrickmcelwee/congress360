    "text": "Small Business Contractor's Clarification Act of 2015\n\nThis bill amends the Small Business Act to revise the federal procurement requirements of the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) with respect to small business contracts for articles, equipment, supplies, services or materials, or to perform construction work for the government.\n\nThe permission to submit an offer for a procurement contract, even though the offeror is not the actual manufacturer or processor of the product in question, is extended to additional kinds of small businesses, including:\n\n women-owned small businesses; HUBZone small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans. Contracts whose principal purpose is acquisition of services or construction are exempt from this Act.\n\nLimitations on SBA subcontracting are revised to require contracts that are principally for supplies from a regular dealer in such supplies, and that are not contracts principally for services or construction, to supply the product of a domestic small business manufacturer or processor, unless a waiver is granted by the Administrator under specified conditions."
