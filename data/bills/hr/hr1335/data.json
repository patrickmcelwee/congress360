    "text": "Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act \n\nThis bill revises and reauthorizes through FY2019 the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA).\n\nRevisions are made to: (1) requirements for fishery management plans for overfished fisheries; and (2) catch limit requirements, including by authorizing Regional Fishery Management Councils to consider changes in an ecosystem and the economic needs of the fishing communities when establishing the limits.\n\nTo distinguish between fish that are depleted due to fishing and those that are depleted for other reasons, the term \"depleted\" replaces the term \"overfished\" throughout the MSA.\n\nFishery impact statements must analyze the impacts of proposed actions in fishery management plans on the quality of the human environment.\n\n The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) must issue regulations governing the use of electronic monitoring of fisheries. NOAA may obligate amounts received as fisheries enforcement penalties for collecting information on data-poor fisheries.\n\n NOAA must publish a plan for implementing the Cooperative Research and Management Program.\n\n The offshore jurisdiction of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama is extended from three miles to nine miles for the recreational management of red snapper.\n\nThe Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission must conduct all fishery stock assessments used for management purposes by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council for the fisheries managed under the Council's Reef Fish Management Plan.\n\nAny commercial catch share allocation in a fishery in the Gulf of Mexico may only be traded by sale or lease within the same commercial fishing sector."
