A termination bill, relating to such circumstances, must be enacted into law to effect a termination of the free trade agreement or a portion of it.\n\nFast track procedures are prescribed for congressional consideration of a termination bill.\n\nThe United States Trade Representative shall:\n\n take specified enforcement actions against any country party to a free trade agreement if it has implemented a tariff or nontariff barrier by reason of enactment into law of a bill terminating the agreement in whole or in part, and ensure that any free trade agreement entered into on or after enactment of this Act is negotiated in a form that provides for the termination with respect to the United States of specific portions of it."
