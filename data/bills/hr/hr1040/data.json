Defines \"business taxable income\" to mean gross active income reduced by the cost of certain business inputs.\n\nImposes an employer tax on the value of excludable compensation provided to employees not engaged in business activity of 19% for the first two years after an election is made under this Act and 17% thereafter.\n\nRepeals the estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer taxes.\n\nRequires a two-thirds vote of the House of Representatives or the Senate to increase the flat tax rate proposed by this Act or to reduce the amount of the standard deduction or business-related deductions allowed by this Act."
