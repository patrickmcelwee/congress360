Requires any devices provided in connection with such alternative service to be incapable of collecting such information.\n\nAllows operators to disclose such information only with the express consent of the consumer or as required by a court order in connection with a law enforcement investigation.\n\nRequires violations of this Act to be treated as unfair or deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act."
