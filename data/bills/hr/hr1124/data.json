Requires grants to be awarded first to qualifying local governments with fewer than 100,000 residents, with any remaining funds awarded to other applicants on a pro rata basis.\n\nDirects the Attorney General to study the cost to state and local law enforcement agencies of purchasing and using body-worn or similar cameras.\n\nEstablishes in the Department of Justice a task force to: (1) provide recommendations on community policing, (2) study the impact that citizen review boards could have on investigating cases of alleged police misconduct, and (3) conduct a survey to determine best practices and the effectiveness of the body camera requirement policy.\n\nDirects the Government Accountability Office to report on the Department of Defense Excess Personal Property Program."
