The duties of the Under Secretary include serving as the principal policy advisor to the DHS Secretary, overseeing and coordinating relationships with outside stakeholders, and managing and coordinating DHS's international engagement activities.\n\nThe Office of Policy includes an Office of Partnership and Engagement, an Office of International Affairs, an Office of Policy Implementation, and an Office of Strategy and Planning.\n\nDHS must complete and report on a review of the international affairs offices, functions, and responsibilities of DHS components to identify and eliminate areas of unnecessary duplication.\n\n(Sec. 105) DHS must conduct a quadrennial review of the homeland security of the United States. The first review must be completed by December 31, 2017, and subsequent reviews by December 31 of every fourth year thereafter.\n\n(Sec. 106) DHS must submit to the congressional homeland security committees, within 30 days after the submission of the President's annual budget to Congress, an annual Future Years Homeland Security Program that covers the current fiscal year and the four succeeding fiscal years. This annual submission must provide: (1) detailed estimates for projected expenditures and corresponding requests for appropriations in the budget request, and (2) projected acquisition estimates for five fiscal years.\n\n(Sec. 107) This section designates the DHS Under Secretary for Management as the Chief Management Officer for all matters related to the management and administration of DHS in support of homeland security operations and programs. The responsibilities of the Chief Management Officer shall include development of the budget, acquisition and procurement activities, human resources and personnel oversight, and oversight of grants and other assistance management programs.\n\n(Sec. 108) This section establishes the position of DHS Chief Financial Officer and sets forth responsibilities for such position, including: (1) leading cost-estimating practices for DHS, (2) developing and overseeing DHS financial management policy, (3) establishing effective internal controls over financial reporting systems, (4) leading and providing guidance on performance-based budgeting practices, and (5) overseeing DHS budget formulation and execution.\n\n(Sec. 109) This section establishes the position of DHS Chief Procurement Officer and sets forth responsibilities for such position, including: (1) exercising leadership and authority over the DHS procurement function; (2) issuing procurement policies; (3) accounting for the integrity, performance, and oversight of DHS procurement contracting functions; (4) serving as DHS's main liaison to industry on procurement-related issues; and (5) ensuring that a fair proportion of federal contract and subcontract dollars are awarded to small businesses.\n\n(Sec. 110) This section assigns additional responsibilities to the DHS Chief Information Officer. The Chief Information Officer shall: (1) develop and report on an information technology strategic plan every five years, and (2) conduct a DHS-wide inventory of all existing software licenses held by DHS and assess the need of DHS for software licenses for the subsequent two fiscal years.\n\n(Sec. 111) This section sets forth additional responsibilities for the DHS Chief Human Capital Officer and requires DHS components to coordinate with the Chief Human Capital Officer to develop or maintain their own five-year workforce strategy for human resource management.\n\n(Sec. 112) This section establishes the position of DHS Chief Security Officer who shall develop and implement DHS security policies, programs, and standards, identify training and education needs, and provide support to DHS components on security-related matters.\n\n(Sec. 113) DHS must submit a report to the congressional homeland security committees that: (1) provides a detailed inventory of the management and administrative expenditures and activities of DHS components that identifies potential cost savings and efficiencies; (2) examines the size, experience level, and geographic distribution of DHS operational personnel; and (3) makes recommendations to reduce deficiencies in DHS's capabilities, reduce costs, and enhance efficiencies.\n\n(Sec. 114) DHS must submit to the congressional homeland security committees a field efficiencies plan that: (1) examines the facilities and administrative and logistics functions of DHS components located within designated geographic areas, and (2) provides specific recommendations and an associated cost-benefits analysis for the consolidation of functions of DHS components.\n\n(Sec. 115) DHS must annually provide information to the congressional homeland security committees on reprogramming or transferring funds by DHS to address unforeseen costs, including the costs associated with operational surges.\n\n(Sec. 116) This section expands requirements for the Homeland Security Rotation Program, which assigns middle and senior-level DHS employees to other components to broaden their knowledge of the missions of such components.\n\nTITLE II--DHS ACQISITION ACCOUNTABILITY AND EFFICIENCY\n\n(Sec. 201) This section defines terms applicable to this title, including \"best practices\" and \"acquisition decision authority.\"\n\nSubtitle A--Acquisition Authorities\n\n(Sec. 211) This section amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to designate the DHS Under Secretary for Management as the Chief Acquisition Officer of DHS.

The strategy shall also include: (1) a plan to address actions to ensure competition for major acquisition programs, and (2) a plan to address DHS acquisition workforce accountability and talent management that identifies acquisition workforce needs and options for filling those needs.\n\n(Sec. 233) The DHS Undersecretary for Management shall submit to the congressional homeland security committees, at the same time as the President's annual fiscal year budget, a comprehensive acquisition status report.\n\n(Sec. 234) The GAO must review and report on the effectiveness of the first multiyear acquisition strategy.\n\n(Sec. 235) This section requires the DHS Inspector General, within two years after GAO submits such report, to report on whether: (1) DHS has complied with the multiyear acquisition strategy and adhered to the strategies set forth in the plan, and (2) DHS has provided the Acquisition Review Board with a capability development plan for each major acquisition program."
