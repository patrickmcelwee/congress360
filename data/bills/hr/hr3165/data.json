Upon receipt of a DHS detainer the District shall hold an arrested alien for up to 48 hours: (1) following conclusion of the District's charging or dismissal proceeding, or (2) after the alien has completed the his or her sentence.\n\n If DHS fails to issue a detainer, no DHS political appointee may perform certain functions until the alien in question has been taken into custody.\n\nAny District officer, acting in his or her official capacity, who knowingly violates the notification or detention requirements under this Act shall pay a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each such violation."
