Directs that any savings resulting from the identification of such funds or budget authority be deposited in the Treasury and used to reduce a budget deficit or the federal debt. Permits the head of an agency to retain up to 10% of such savings for the purpose of paying cash awards to employees who identify surplus funds or unnecessary budget authority.\n\nProhibits the payment of awards to: (1) the head of an agency; (2) federal officers who serve in a position at level I of the Executive Schedule; or (3) a voting member of an independent establishment."
