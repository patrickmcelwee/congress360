    "text": "Nonprofit Property Protection Act\n\nThis bill:\n\n amends the Liability Risk Retention Act of 1986 to rename it the Risk Retention Act of 1986; and exclude from \"commercial insurance\" covered by the Act any health, life, or disability insurance or workers compensation insurance or express contractual obligations owed to a consumer as a result of a personal, family, or household transaction, where the consumer pays a separate consideration for the express contractual obligation. The bill expands the kinds of state laws pertaining to business insurance from which a risk retention group shall be exempt to include laws pertaining to other lines of commercial insurance offered by a risk retention group to an entity organized and operated exclusively as a federal tax-exempt nonprofit charitable or educational institution, as long as the group meets specified criteria."
