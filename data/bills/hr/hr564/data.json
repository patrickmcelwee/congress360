These permits may be renewed by NOAA.\n\nThe permits may authorize the lethal taking of 10 sea lions or fewer. The cumulative annual taking of sea lions each year under all such permits is limited to 1% of the annual potential biological removal level.\n\nThese permits are exempted from environmental review requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 for five years.\n\nNOAA may suspend the issuance of such permits if, after five years, lethal removal authority is no longer necessary to protect salmonid and other fish species from sea lion predation."
