In selecting a consortium, DHS must consider: (1) any prior experience conducting cybersecurity training and exercises for state and local entities, and (2) the geographic diversity of its members to cover different regions across the United States.\n\nDHS must conduct outreach to universities and colleges regarding opportunities to support efforts to address cybersecurity risks and incidents.\n\nDHS's authority to carry out this bill terminates five years after its enactment."
