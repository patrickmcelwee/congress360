(Current law requires payment to a state of 50% of all money derived from such sales, bonuses, royalties, and rentals.)\n\nRequires any person, after a conveyance under this Act, to pay directly to the state any amount the person owes for which the right, title, and interest has been conveyed to the state.\n\nRequires the Secretary to provide prompt notice of any such conveyance, and the duty to make direct payments to the state involved, to each holder of a lease of public land to which this Act applies."
