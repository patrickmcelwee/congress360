Appropriations are made to fund the loan guarantees.\n\nTreasury may also provide advice and technical assistance to the government of Puerto Rico.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Act is amended to empower Federal Reserve banks to buy and sell bonds and notes issued by Puerto Rico in anticipation of the collection of taxes or receipt of assured revenues."
