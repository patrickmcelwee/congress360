    "text": "Securing Access to Networks in Disasters Act\n\nThis bill requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to commence proceedings on the provision of roaming agreements between mobile service providers to: (1) allow for mobile service at reasonable rates during emergencies when there is a mobile service outage lasting longer than 24 hours, and (2) provide for roaming agreements at no charge for communications during emergencies to or from 911 services.\n\nThe types of emergencies subject to this Act are: (1) occasions or instances under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act for which the President determines that federal assistance is needed to supplement state and local efforts and capabilities to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of the United States; or (2) an emergency declared by the governor of a state or U.S. territory.\n\nThe FCC must create a master point of contact directory for communications between public safety answering points and telecommunications service providers.\n\nThe FCC must also submit a study on mobile service providers supplying outage data to public safety answering points and on making WiFi access points available to the public for 911 services during emergencies.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on the resiliency of telecommunications networks power utility during emergencies.\n\nThe Stafford Act is amended to include all categories of communications service providers (currently, only telecommunications service providers) among the essential service providers that may access a disaster site to restore and repair essential services in an emergency or major disaster without being denied or impeded by a federal agency. Communications services include wireline and mobile telephone, Internet, radio and television broadcasting, cable, and direct broadcast satellite services.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) must: (1) ensure that essential service providers have escorts to relevant locations and priority access to relevant resources, and (2) establish a program to provide credentials to essential service providers to facilitate such access."
