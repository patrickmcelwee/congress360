The FDA may authorize a product developer to conduct testing and clinical trials with the medication.\n\nA wholesaler or specialty distributor who receives a request from a product developer for a medication for testing may not disclose to the license holder the identity of the product developer. The FDA may prohibit or limit transfer of a medication to a product developer if the transfer poses an imminent hazard to public health.\n\nLicense holders are not liable for claims arising from a product developer testing the medication.\n\nThe FDA may waive the requirement that a drug use a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use with a comparable approved drug if the product developer is unable to finalize terms for a shared system with the license holder of the approved drug."
