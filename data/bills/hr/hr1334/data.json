The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nHolding Company Registration Threshold Equalization Act of 2015\n\n (Sec. 2) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require an issuer that is a savings and loan holding company to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission if: (1) its assets exceed $10 million, and (2) it has a class of equity security held of record by 2,000 or more persons.\n\nRequires termination of such registration after a savings and loan holding company certifies that its holders of record of that class of security have been reduced to fewer than 1,200 persons.\n\nSuspends automatically the duty of a savings and loan holding company to file supplementary and periodic information if the securities of each class to which the registration statement relates (other than any class of asset-backed securities) are held of record by fewer than 1,200 persons."
