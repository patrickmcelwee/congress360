The bill also removes 0-bedroom housing from the definition of target housing.\n\nThe Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act is amended to direct HUD to promulgate regulations that:\n\n require an initial lead-based paint hazard risk assessment before a family with a child under age six occupies certain housing, unless lead-based paint has already been removed; and state that a visual assessment is not sufficient for these purposes. These regulations shall apply to housing receiving federal assistance that was constructed before 1978, but exclude:\n\n single-family housing covered by an application for mortgage insurance from the Federal Housing Administration, or multi-family housing covered by such an application but does not receive any other federal housing assistance. HUD regulations shall also require emergency relocation of such families, without placement on a waitlist, penalty, or lapse in assistance, to another unit of covered housing that has no lead-based paint hazards.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office shall report to Congress on lead hazards in federally assisted housing."
