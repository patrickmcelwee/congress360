It also indexes several user fees for inflation, including customs user fees and Transportation Security Administration fees.\n\nThe bill decreases the dividend payment that the Federal Reserve pays on stocks held by member banks to participate in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFederal Employees Retirement System contributions are increased for some current federal employees.\n\nThe Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to consolidate and make several changes to income-based student loan repayment programs.\n\nThe Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to reduce federal payments for crop insurance premium subsidies."
