(Sec. 102) The amounts authorized and the authorized personnel ceilings as of September 30, 2016, for such activities are those in the classified Schedule of Authorizations, which shall be made available to the congressional appropriations committees and the President.\n\n(Sec. 103) The DNI, if it provides prior notification to Congress, may authorize employment of civilian personnel in excess of the number authorized for FY2016 when necessary for the performance of important intelligence functions.\n\nThe DNI must establish guidelines to govern the treatment under such authorized personnel levels of employment or assignment in: (1) a student or trainee program; (2) a reserve corps or as a reemployed annuitant; or (3) details, joint duty, or long-term, full-time training.\n\n(Sec. 104) The bill authorizes FY2016 appropriations for the Intelligence Community Management Account, as well as for personnel positions for elements within such account.

The strategy must ensure that the U.S. national security overhead satellite architecture: (1) aims to produce satellite systems in less than five years that can leverage common, standardized design elements and commercially available technologies; (2) is open to distributed, disaggregated architectures that allow for better resiliency, reconstitution, replenishment, and rapid technological refresh; and (3) emphasizes deterrence and the importance of offensive and defensive space control capabilities.\n\n(Sec. 313) The DNI must carry out a study and report findings to Congress regarding appropriate standards to measure the damage of cyber incidents for purposes of determining the response to such incidents, including a method to quantify damage to affected computers, systems, and devices.\n\nTITLE IV--MATTERS RELATING TO ELEMENTS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY\n\nSubtitle A--Office of the Director of National Intelligence\n\n(Sec. 401) The bill requires the National Counterintelligence Executive to be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.
