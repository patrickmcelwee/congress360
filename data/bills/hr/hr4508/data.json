The bill directs Labor, 60 days before any increase in the minimum wage, to publish it in the Federal Register and on Labor's website.\n\nThe bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an employer who pays at least $1 more per hour than the federal minimum wage, but not more than $15 per hour, a credit against the employment tax equal to 6.2% of wages paid by such employer during the calendar year."
