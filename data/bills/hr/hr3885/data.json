An eligibility determination made as part of such physical examination shall be binding on the VA and be used as the basis for assigning the member's disability rating.\n\nThe VA and the Department of Defense shall jointly establish a system to share data and maintain the medical and personnel records of members of the Armed Forces and veterans."
