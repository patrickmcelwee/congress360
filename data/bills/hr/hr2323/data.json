Retains the brand names of the individual grantees.\n\nSpecifies FNN standards and principles, including consistency with broad U.S. foreign policy objectives.\n\nDirects USICA and FNN to establish procedures to vet and monitor employees for affiliations to terrorist organizations, foreign governments to protect against espionage, sabotage, foreign propaganda messaging, and other subversive activities."
