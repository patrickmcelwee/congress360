    "text": "Public Power Risk Management Act of 2015\n\n Amends the Commodity Exchange Act to direct the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), when it determines whether to provide an exemption to designation as a swap dealer, to treat a utility operations-related swap entered into with a utility special entity as if such swap were entered into with an entity that is not a special entity. (Thus exempts an entity entering into a utility operations-related swap with a utility special entity from mandatory registration as a swap dealer.)\n\nRequires transactions in utility operations-related swaps to be reported according to requirements for the reporting of uncleared swaps.\n\nDefines \"utility special entity\" as a special entity, or any instrumentality, department, or corporation of or established by a state or local government, that: (1) owns or operates, or anticipates owning or operating, an electric or natural gas facility or an electric or natural gas operation; (2) supplies or anticipates supplying natural gas or electric energy to another utility special entity; (3) has or anticipates having public service obligations under federal, state, or local law or regulation to deliver electric energy or natural gas service to customers; or (4) is a federal power marketing agency.\n\nRedefines swap to include a utility operations-related swap.\n\nDefines \"utility operations-related swap\" as one that: (1) is entered into to hedge or mitigate commercial risk; (2) is associated with specified transactions in electric energy or natural gas; and (3) is not a contract, agreement, or transaction based on, derived on, or referencing:\n\n an interest rate, credit, equity, or currency asset class; a metal, agricultural commodity, or crude oil or gasoline commodity of any grade, except as used as fuel for electric energy generation; and any other commodity or category of commodities identified for this purpose in a CFTC rule or order adopted in consultation with federal and state regulatory commissions."
