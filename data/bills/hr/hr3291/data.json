(A crosswalk shows users where to put data from one scheme into a different scheme.)\n\nSpecifically, CMS must develop HCPCS versions for MS-DRGs that is similar to the Internal Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) codes for such MS-DRGs such that, to the extent possible, the MS-DRG assignment shall be similar for a claim coded with the HCPCS version as an identical claim coded with an ICD-10-PCS code.\n\nCMS must develop and publish a freely available HCPCS/MS-DRG definitions manual and software."
