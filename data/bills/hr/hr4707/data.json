HUD may also award such funds to an alternative grantee if the original grantee agrees in a written document meeting HUD approval.\n\nReferences to \"cases of AIDS\" and \"AIDS cases\" shall be replaced by \"individuals living with HIV or AIDS,\" which means, with respect to the counting of cases in a geographic area during a period of time, the sum of:\n\n the number of living non-AIDS cases of HIV in the area, and the number of living cases of AIDS in the area."
