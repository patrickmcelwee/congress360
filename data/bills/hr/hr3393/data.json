A table-funded transaction is not a transaction in the secondary mortgage.\n\nCompensation from any source shall not include any compensation taken into account in settling the mortgage interest rate and for which there is no separate charge to the consumer.\n\nSuch compensation shall include, however, any other compensation paid directly or indirectly by a consumer or creditor to an individual employed by or contracting with the originator or a mortgage originator."
