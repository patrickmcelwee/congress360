Securities acquired in such exempt transactions shall be deemed to: (1) have been acquired in a transaction not involving any public offering, (2) not be a distribution involving an underwriter, and (2) be restricted securities not subject to certain transaction requirements.\n\nAll transactions under this Act shall be exempt from state regulation of securities offerings."
