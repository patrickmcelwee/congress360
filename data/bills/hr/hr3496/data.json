Subjects satellite carriers to such requirements only to the extent that such retransmissions are technically feasible.\n\nDefines \"in-state, adjacent-market network station retransmission\" as the secondary transmission by a cable operator or satellite carrier of the primary transmission of any network station whose community of license is located: (1) in a subscriber's state, and (2) in a local market that is adjacent to the subscriber's local market.\n\nProvides for this Act to apply, with respect to such an in-state, adjacent-market network station retransmission to a subscriber, to specified Wisconsin counties (Barron, Burnett, Dunn, Pierce, Polk, St. Croix, and Washburn) that are not in the local market of any television broadcast station that is affiliated with the same network and whose community of license is located in the subscriber's state.\n\nExempts in-state, adjacent-market network station retransmissions in such counties from: (1) retransmission consent requirements that prohibit cable operators from retransmitting broadcast stations without the authority of the originating station, and (2) statutory licensing limitations under federal copyright laws concerning satellite retransmissions to unserved households and secondary transmissions of distant signals."
