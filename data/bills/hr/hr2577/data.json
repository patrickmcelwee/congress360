    "text": "Highlights: \n\nThe Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016 provides FY2016 appropriations for the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and several related agencies.\n\nThe bill includes both discretionary and mandatory funding. The HUD budget is primarily discretionary spending, and most of the DOT budget is mandatory spending, in the form of contract authority from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF).\n\nThe bill increases overall funding for Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies above FY2015 levels. Compared to FY2015 levels, the bill decreases funding for DOT and increases funding for HUD.\n\nWithin the DOT budget, the bill:\n\n increases funding for the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration, and the Maritime Administration; decreases funding for the Federal Transit Administration and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration; and funds the Federal Aid Highway Program and National Infrastructure Investments (Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery or TIGER grants) at the FY2015 level. Within the HUD budget, the bill:\n\n increases funding for the Tenant-Based Rental Assistance and Project-Based Rental Assistance accounts that fund the low-income housing programs under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937; decreases funding for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) formula program and the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. For Public Housing, the bill increases funding for the Public Housing Operating Fund and decreases funding for both the Public Housing Capital Fund and Choice Neighborhoods compared to FY2015 levels.\n\nThe bill decreases funding for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation.\n\nAlso included in the bill are provisions that would:\n\n affect limits on truck size and weight, restrict enforcement of regulations for commercial truck drivers' rest, limit the use of funds to increase minimum insurance requirements for truckers and bus drivers, and prohibit the use of funds for a proposed rule requiring airlines to display ancillary fees in ticket prices.
