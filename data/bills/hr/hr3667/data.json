Special Procedures used to display bias against the United States or Israel or to provide support for any member state which is subject to Security Council sanctions, under a Security Council-mandated human rights investigation, has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism, or is a country of particular concern for religious freedom or Tier 3 human trafficking. States that it is U.S. policy to oppose any legitimization of the Gaza report and to lead a diplomatic campaign supporting its revocation.\n\nDirects the Department to withhold from the U.S. contribution to the regular budget of the U.N. an amount that is equal to the percentage of such contribution that would be or has been expended by the U.N. for: (1) any part of the Gaza report process, and (2) any conference that advocated restrictions on free speech, religion, or other human rights and freedoms.\n\nWithholds U.S. contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) or to any successor or related entity unless the Secretary makes specified certifications to Congress.\n\n Expresses the sense of Congress with respect to UNRWA, including the withholding of U.S. contributions to UNRWA.\n\nProhibits any U.S. contribution to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) from being used to support Technical Cooperation program assistance to North Korea and to any country that: (1) has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism; or (2) is in breach of, or under investigation for breach of, obligations regarding its safeguards agreement with the IAEA, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or any relevant Security Council resolution.\n\nDirects the Department to withhold from the U.S. voluntary contribution to the IAEA an amount proportional to that spent by the IAEA on Technical Cooperation program assistance to such countries.\n\n Directs the President to use U.S. influence at the IAEA to block the Board of Governors membership of a state that has not signed, ratified, and implemented the Additional Protocol and is under investigation for a breach of, or noncompliance with, its IAEA obligations or principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n\n Expresses the sense of Congress that U.S. national security interests are enhanced by the IAEA's Nuclear Security Action Plan and a resolution incorporating the Plan into the IAEA's regular budget should be adopted.\n\nSets forth U.S. policy regarding reform of U.N. peacekeeping operations.\n\nDirects the President to use U.S. influence at the U.N. to oppose the creation of new, or expansion of existing, U.N. peacekeeping operations until the Department certifies to Congress that specified peacekeeping reforms have been adopted by the U.N.
