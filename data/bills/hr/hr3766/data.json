The President shall provide Congress with a detailed description of such guidelines.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office shall submit a report to Congress that: (1) analyzes such guidelines; and (2) compares the President's fiscal year budget request of every operational unit that carries out U.S. foreign development and economic assistance, and the prior year's performance of such units.\n\n(Sec. 3) The Department of State shall update its Internet website, ForeignAssistance.gov, to make publicly available comprehensive and accessible information on U.S. foreign development and economic assistance programs.\n\nThe head of each federal department or agency that administers U.S. foreign development and economic assistance shall provide the State Department each quarter with comprehensive information about such assistance programs.\n\nAssistance program information shall be published: (1) on an award-by-award and country-by-country basis, or (2) on an award-by-award and region-by-region basis if provided on a regional level.\n\nSuch information shall include: (1) links to all regional, country, and sector assistance strategies, annual budget documents, congressional budget justifications, and evaluations; (2) basic descriptive summaries for foreign development and economic assistance programs and awards under such programs; and (3) obligations and expenditures.\n\nIf the head of a federal department or agency determines that the inclusion of a required item of information online would jeopardize the health or security of an implementing partner or program beneficiary or would require the release of proprietary information, he or she shall provide such determination along with a briefing or written report to Congress.\n\nIf the State Department determines that the inclusion of a required item of information online would be detrimental to U.S. national interests the State Department shall provide such determination to Congress along with a briefing or written report.\n\nIf a federal department or agency fails to provide required information that is not otherwise excluded from such requirement, the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the head of such department or agency, shall submit to Congress by September 1, 2016, a report describing for each required information item not made publicly available:\n\n the reason for not making such information publicly available; and the department's or agency's plan and time line for making such information publicly available, and for ensuring that future information is made available. (Sec. 4) Specified terms are defined."
