Requires LEAs to ensure that private school personnel can participate, on an equitable basis, in activities supported by such funds.\n\nAuthorizes ED to allocate funds to the Department of the Interior to carry out such activities with regard to schools operated or funded by such Department.\n\nDirects\u00a0ED to conduct a national assessment to determine compliance with this Act's requirements and identify best practices regarding positive behavior support professional training programs.\n\nGives Protection and Advocacy Systems the authority provided under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 to investigate, monitor, and enforce this Act's protections for students."
