These requirements shall not apply to the U.S. refugee admission of an alien who: (1) provided substantial assistance to the United States, and (2) would face a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury because of that assistance if not admitted to the United States.\n\nThe State Department may designate as a country containing terrorist-controlled territory any country containing territory controlled, in substantial part, by a foreign terrorist organization to the exclusion of that country's recognized government.\n\nThe State Department shall maintain and continually update a list of: (1) the countries containing terrorist-controlled territory, and (2) groups identified as victims of genocide.\n\nAn alien may not be admitted into the United States under this Act solely based on his or her assertions, and DHS must substantiate any such assertions with the State Department, DOD, the FBI, and the DNI."
