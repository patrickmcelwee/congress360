Directs the consortia to develop and implement a local child and youth strategy that integrates multiple private and public services into a comprehensive, coordinated continuum of services directed toward achieving quantifiable progress toward such goals.\n\nRequires the Secretary to award competitive grants directly to local consortia if appropriated funds fall below a specified amount."
