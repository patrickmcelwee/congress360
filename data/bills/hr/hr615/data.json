Directs the Under Secretary to submit with such strategy information on: (1) any intra-agency effort or task force that has been delegated responsibilities relating to achieving and maintaining interoperable communications by such dates; and (2) who, within each component, is responsible for implementing policies and directives issued by the Under Secretary to achieve and maintain interoperable communications.\n\n(Sec. 5) Directs the Under Secretary, within 100 days after the strategy is submitted and every 2 years thereafter for 6 years, to submit reports on the status of efforts to implement such strategy, including: (1) progress on interim milestones; (2) information on establishment by the Under Secretary of, and compliance of DHS components with, policies, directives, guidance, and training to achieve and maintain interoperable communications; and (3) information on any additional resources or authorities needed by the Under Secretary."
