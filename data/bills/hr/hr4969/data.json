(Opioids are drugs with effects similar to opium, such as heroin and certain pain medications.) The report must determine the extent this information is available to teenagers and adolescents who play youth sports, their families, youth sports groups, and health care providers.\n\nTaking into consideration the findings of the report, HHS must develop and disseminate such information."
