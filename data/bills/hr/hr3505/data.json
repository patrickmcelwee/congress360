    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Clearance Management and Administration Act\n\n(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require that the designation of the sensitivity level of national security positions be conducted in a consistent manner in all Department of Homeland Security (DHS) components and offices, consistent with federal guidelines. DHS must use uniform designation tools throughout DHS and provide training to appropriate staff.\n\nThe bill requires DHS: (1) by July 6, 2017, and every five years thereafter, to review all sensitivity level designations of national security positions at DHS; (2) if it determines that a change in the sensitivity level is warranted, to administratively adjust access and complete an appropriate level periodic reinvestigation; and (3) to report on such positions requiring access to classified information, no longer requiring access, or requiring a different level of access.\n\nDHS's Inspector General must conduct regular audits of DHS compliance with regulations regarding such designations.\n\nDHS must submit an annual report, through FY2021, on the denials, suspensions, revocations, and appeals of an individual's eligibility for access to classified information in DHS.\n\nDHS must: (1) develop a plan to achieve greater uniformity regarding the adjudication of eligibility of an individual for access to classified information that is consistent with the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Access to Classified Information, and (2) ensure that all information received for such adjudication is consistent with such Guidelines and is protected against misappropriation. The plan shall consider the establishment of an internal appeals panel responsible for final national security clearance denial and revocation determinations."
