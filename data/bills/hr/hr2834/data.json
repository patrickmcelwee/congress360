Subtitle I of Title 55 contains provisions that establish the Environmental Protection Agency, national environmental policy, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and the Council on Environmental Quality. Subtitle II contains provisions about air quality and air pollution control, including provisions from the Clean Air Act and related laws.\n\nA change in wording made in the restatement of existing law enacted by this bill is meant to elucidate the existing law, but not to change the meaning or effect of the existing law."
