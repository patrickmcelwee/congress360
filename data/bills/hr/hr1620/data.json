Repeals the authorization for states to use certain funds for construction of pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities.\n\nEliminates the requirement that statewide transportation plans and statewide transportation improvement programs provide for the development of accessible pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that states, federal agencies, localities, and private stakeholders should take steps toward increased cooperation to further expedite surface transportation projects."
