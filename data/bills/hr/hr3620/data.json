The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\n(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area Improvement Act with respect to the prohibition against the use of Highway 209, a federally owned road within the boundaries of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in Pennsylvania, by certain commercial vehicles except as they serve businesses located within or in the vicinity of the Recreation Area.\n\nThe local business use exception to the prohibition is revised to permit, until September 30, 2020, the use of commercial vehicles with four or fewer axles that are: (1) owned and operated by a business located in the Recreation Area or one or more adjacent municipalities, or (2) necessary to provide services to businesses or persons located in the Recreation Area or one or more such municipalities.\n\nThe adjacent municipalities referred to are Delaware Township, Dingman Township, Lehman Township, Matamoras Borough, Middle Smithfield Township, Milford Borough, Milford Township, Smithfield Township, and Westfall Township in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Department of the Interior shall establish a fee and permit program for the use of Highway 209 by commercial vehicles, including an annual fee of up to $200 per vehicle. All fees received shall be set aside in a special account and be available for the administration and enforcement of the program, including registering vehicles, issuing permits and vehicle identification stickers, and personnel costs.\n\nThe following vehicles may use Highway 209 without a fee or permit requirement:\n\n local school buses; fire, ambulance, and other safety and emergency vehicles; and commercial vehicles along specified segments of the highway."
