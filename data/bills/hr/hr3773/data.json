DOT may also administer state safety oversight activities for a rail fixed guideway system operating in more than two states, if the state safety oversight agency overseeing the system has become incapable of providing adequate safety oversight, until the states involved develop a state safety oversight program that DOT certifies as meeting specified criteria."
