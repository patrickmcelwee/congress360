A state registry that receives a grant must be accessible to individual donors and the Center.\n\nA person taking an individual's organs is not civilly liable as long as the person verified the individual's consent with a state organ donor registry.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must study the feasibility of establishing a database to track the health effects of living organ donation."
