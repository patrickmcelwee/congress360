Directs the President to designate an interagency committee on engineering biology to oversee the planning, management, and coordination of the Program.\n\nRequires the President to designate an advisory committee on engineering biology research and development to assess the progress being made in implementing the Program.\n\nDirects the National Science Foundation to contract with the National Academies to convene a workshop to review the ethical, legal, environmental, and other appropriate societal issues related to engineering biology research and development.\n\nRequires the National Science Foundation, National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Department of Energy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Environmental Protection Agency to carry out specified research activities as part of the Program."
