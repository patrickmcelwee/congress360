Subjects small businesses to fines, imprisonment, or both for not acting in good faith.\n\nRequires the VA's Chief Acquisition Officer and the Director of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization to: (1) establish a process to monitor the subcontracting requirement compliance of veterans' small businesses that are awarded VA contracts, and (2) refer violations to the VA's Inspector General. Directs the Inspector General to submit annual reports to Congress regarding such violations."
