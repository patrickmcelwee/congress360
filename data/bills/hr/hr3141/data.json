ED must provide LEAs with policy guidance regarding safe relationship behavior training and the promotion of safe and healthy relationships.\n\nESEA funds may not be used for sex or HIV-prevention education in schools if that instruction does not include safe relationship behavior education. (Under current law, sex or HIV-prevention education in schools must be age appropriate and include the health benefits of abstinence.)"
