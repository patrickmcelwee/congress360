The President should:\n\n implement policies to facilitate trans-boundary trade among eligible sub-Saharan African countries; provide training for business in such countries and government trade officials on accessing the benefits of AGOA and other trade preference programs; and provide capacity building for African entrepreneurs and trade associations, promoting product diversification and value-added processing, and helping businesses and institutions comply with U.S. counter-terrorism initiatives and policies. An eligible country that has entered into and has in effect a Millennium Challenge Compact under the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 may also enter into and have in effect at the same time not more than one additional Compact if:\n\n one or both of the Compacts are or will be for purposes of regional economic integration, increased regional trade, or cross-border collaborations; and the country is making considerable and demonstrable progress in implementing the terms of the existing Compact."
