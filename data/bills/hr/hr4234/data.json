To be eligible to participate, a physician must agree to provide primary care at a health center for at least two years.\n\nGrantees must assist reentering physicians by providing training, paying credentialing and other necessary fees, paying salaries, and providing loan repayment and other financial assistance.\n\nHHS must: (1) assess the need for additional primary care physicians, (2) develop a directory of programs that help physicians reenter clinical practice, (3) disseminate evaluation tools to measure the core competencies of physicians reentering clinical practice, and (4) assist regulatory and credentialing authorities to structure requirements for reentering physicians that ensure patient safety while addressing the burdens on those physicians.\n\n This bill limits civil liability for physicians participating in a reentry project."
