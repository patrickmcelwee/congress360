The expanded summary of the House reported version is repeated here.)\n\nContracting and Tax Accountability Act of 2015\n\n(Sec. 2) Declares it the policy of the U.S. government that no government contracts or grants should be awarded to individuals or companies with seriously delinquent federal tax debts.\n\n(Sec. 3) Requires the head of any executive agency that issues an invitation for bids or a request for proposals for a contract, or that offers a grant, in an amount greater than the simplified acquisition threshold, to require each person submitting a bid or proposal or grant application to: (1) certify that such person does not have a seriously delinquent tax debt, and (2) authorize the Department of the Treasury to disclose information limited to describing whether such person has a seriously delinquent tax debt. Subjects a person who has a seriously delinquent tax debt to a negative responsibility or high risk determination when applying for a federal contract or grant, or to suspension or debarment from the federal procurement process. Authorizes an agency head to waive a suspension or debarment proceeding for a person with a seriously delinquent tax debt upon a written finding of urgent and compelling circumstances significantly affecting the interests of the United States.\n\n(Sec. 5) Defines \"seriously delinquent tax debt\" as a federal tax liability that has been assessed by the Internal Revenue Service and is collectible by levy or a court proceeding, except a tax debt: (1) that is being paid in a timely manner under an approved installment agreement or an offer-in-compromise, (2) for which a collection due process hearing has been requested or is pending; (3) for which a continuous levy has been issued or agreed to by an applicant for employment, or (4) with respect to which such a levy is released because it has been determined to be an economic hardship to the taxpayer.\n\n(Sec. 6) Makes this Act applicable to contracts and grants awarded on or after 270 days after the enactment date of this Act."
