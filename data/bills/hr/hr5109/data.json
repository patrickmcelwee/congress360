The reports must detail:\n\n the number of such investigations the FTC has commenced and the disposition of investigations that concluded with official agency action; and the number of investigations the FTC has closed with no official agency action, along with a description that indicates the legal analysis supporting the FTC's decision not to continue such investigations, and the industry sectors of the entities subject to each such investigation. The bill prohibits the FTC from identifying a person who is the subject of an investigation in its description of an investigation that closed with no official agency action."
