Requires grantees to conduct periodic independent evaluations of their effectiveness in accomplishing those activities.\n\nProhibits the Secretary from: (1) endorsing or approving any STEM curriculum designed for use in an elementary school, secondary school, or institution of higher education; or (2) requiring a state, local educational agency, or school to adopt a specific STEM program or instructional materials."
