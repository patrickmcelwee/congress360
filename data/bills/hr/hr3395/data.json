Amends the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012, to repeal prohibitions against using appropriated funds to: (1) promulgate or implement any rule requiring a physical inventory of any firearms business; or (2) disclose contents of the Firearms Trace System database maintained by the National Trace Center of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives or any information required to be kept by firearms licensees except as specified in that Act."
