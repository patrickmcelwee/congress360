    "text": "American Indian Empowerment Act of 2015\n\n Requires the Secretary of the Interior to transfer land the federal government holds in trust for a federally recognized Indian tribe to such tribe as restricted fee tribal land, subject to a restriction against alienation and taxation, after receiving the Indian tribe's request for such transfer. (Restricted fee tribal land is land to which a tribe holds legal title, but which carries legal restrictions against alienation or encumbrance.)\n\nAllows Indian tribes to lease, or grant an easement or right-of-way on, restricted fee tribal land for any period of time without the Secretary's review and approval.\n\nGives the laws of a federally recognized Indian tribe that establish a system of land tenure governing the use of the land the tribe holds precedence over any federal law or regulation governing the use of such land, excepting a federal restriction against its alienation and taxation."
