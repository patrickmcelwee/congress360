The study shall identify:\n\n isolation measures that are necessary to separate critical software systems that can affect the driver's control of the movement of the vehicle from other software systems; measures that are necessary to detect and prevent or minimize anomalous codes, in vehicle software systems, associated with malicious behavior; techniques that are necessary to detect and prevent, discourage, or mitigate intrusions into vehicle software systems and other cybersecurity risks in motor vehicles; and best practices to secure driving data about a vehicle's status or about the owner, lessee, driver, or passenger of a vehicle that is collected by the electronic systems of motor vehicles."
