The bill defines \"qualified small employer\" as an employer who: (1) has a place of business in a county with an annual unemployment rate that is at least 1% greater than the national rate for the preceding calendar year; and (2) did not employ fewer than 2, or more than 100, employees in the preceding calendar year. The bill allows an employer who is a tax-exempt organization to claim such credit. The credit is not available for wages paid after December 31, 2017."
