Requires such certification to ensure amendments to ICANN bylaws to prohibit ICANN from: (1) engaging in activities unrelated to ICANN's core mission of managing the IANA functions and proposing and overseeing policy decisions central to coordinating the global interoperability and uniqueness of Internet domain names; or (2) agreeing to impose on a registrar or registry any condition, such as a regulation of content, that is unrelated to ICANN's core mission.\n\nRequires such a certification to also ensure amendments to bylaws concerning: (1) Governmental Advisory Committee advice and policy proposals, and (2) a required supermajority of the board of directors for votes regarding changes to bylaws.\n\nDirects the Assistant Secretary, if such a certification is not submitted to Congress by a specified deadline, to extend through September 30, 2017, the existing IANA functions contract under which ICANN is required to perform IANA functions."
