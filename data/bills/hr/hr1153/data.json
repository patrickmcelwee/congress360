Authorizes the President to make such alien's visa records public.\n\nTerminates the refugee or asylee status of an alien who:\n\n without a compelling reason returns to the country of such alien's nationality or, in the case of an alien having no nationality, returns to the country in which such alien last habitually resided; and applied for such status because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Makes such provision inapplicable to an alien who is eligible for adjustment to lawful permanent resident status pursuant to the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966.\n\n Allows up to 500 grants of asylum per fiscal year to families fleeing home school persecution.\n\n Requires that a written warning be included in an asylum application advising the alien of the consequences of filing a frivolous application.\n\n States that if an alien's asylum status is subject to termination the immigration judge shall first determine whether the termination conditions have been met, and if so, terminate the alien's asylum status before considering whether the alien is eligible for adjustment of status."
