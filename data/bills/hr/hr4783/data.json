The Small Business Administration shall modify its policy directives to make clear that (Historically Underutilized Business) HUBZone small business concerns owned and controlled by Alaska Native Corporations, Indian tribal governments, and Native Hawaiian Organizations are eligible to receive SBIR and STTR awards."
