(Opioids are drugs with effects similar to opium, such as heroin and certain pain medications.)\n\nGrant recipients may use the funds to purchase opioid overdose reversal drugs, establish a program for prescribing such drugs, train health care providers and pharmacists, track patients and outcomes, offset patient cost sharing, conduct community outreach, and connect patients to treatment.\n\n(Sec. 3) HHS may provide information to prescribers in federally qualified health centers and Indian Health Service facilities on best practices for prescribing opioid overdose reversal drugs for patients at an elevated risk of overdose.\n\n(Sec. 4) As an offset, this bill reduces the authorization of appropriations for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention facilities."
