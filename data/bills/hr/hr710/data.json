    "text": "Essential Transportation Worker Identification Credential Assessment Act\n\n(Sec. 2) This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to commission a national laboratory or a university-based center within the DHS centers of excellence network to conduct a two-phase comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) Program at enhancing security and reducing security risks for maritime facilities and vessels that pose a high risk of being involved in a transportation security incident.\n\nThe assessment shall include: (1) in Phase 1, a review of the credentialing process; (2) in Phase 2, which shall follow the implementation of the TWIC reader rule, an evaluation of the extent to which the TWIC Program addresses security risks in the maritime environment and the technology, business process, and operational impacts of the use of the transportation worker identification credentials and TWIC readers in the maritime environment; (3) an evaluation of the extent to which deficiencies identified by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have been addressed; and (4) a cost-benefit analysis of the TWIC Program.\n\n If the assessment identifies a deficiency in effectiveness of the TWIC Program, DHS shall submit to Congress a corrective action plan that: (1) responds to the assessment and includes an implementation plan with benchmarks, and (2) shall be considered in any DHS rulemaking with respect to the TWIC Program.\n\nThe DHS Inspector General, after submission of the corrective action plan, shall: (1) review the extent to which such plan implements the recommendations of the national laboratory or university-based center and of the GAO, and (2) notify Congress about the plan's responsiveness to such recommendations.\n\nDHS may not issue additional rules with respect to the issuance of transportation worker identification credentials or use of TWIC readers until: (1) the Inspector General notifies Congress that the corrective action plan is responsive to the Inspector General's recommendations, and (2) DHS issues an updated list of TWIC readers that are compatible with active transportation worker security credentials. Such prohibition is inapplicable with respect to any final rule issued pursuant to the notice of proposed rulemaking on TWIC-Reader Requirements published by the Coast Guard on March 22, 2013.\n\nThe Inspector General shall report to Congress on implementation of the corrective action plan within 18 months after the plan is issued and every 6 months thereafter for the next three years."
