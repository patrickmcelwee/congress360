Prohibits waivers by a covered federal agency for products produced in a foreign country that is determined by the U.S. Trade Representative to have violated the terms of an agreement with the United States by discriminating against products produced in the United States that are covered by the agreement.\n\nProhibits a covered federal agency from imposing financial assistance restrictions on: (1) states that impose more stringent requirements on the use of iron and steel in foreign countries in projects carried out with such assistance, or (2) recipients that comply with such state imposed requirements.\n\nMakes any person who intentionally mislabels or misrepresents a product used in a project under this Act as \"Made in America\" ineligible for another department contract for six years.\n\nRequires DOT to: (1) publish a justification for a waiver of the prohibition against obligating funds to carry out the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982, highway projects, public transportation projects, or aviation programs unless the steel, iron, and manufactured products used are produced in the United States; and (2) provide for public notice and comment on such waiver."
