If the asset remains frozen or otherwise blocked after a year, Treasury shall require the financial institution holding the frozen asset to transfer it to the Treasury.\n\nTreasury shall:\n\n deposit all money received under such asset confiscation requirements into the Confiscated Assets Fund, and sell any non-monetary assets received under the bill and deposit the proceeds into the Fund. The Treasury shall establish the Confiscated Assets Fund, which shall be made available to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to make grants under the Urban Area Security Initiative (for assisting high-risk urban areas in preventing, preparing for, protecting against, and responding to acts of terrorism).\n\nThe Government Accountability Office shall study how the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control can better track frozen assets, manage data related to them, and improve reporting to Congress about them across all sanctions programs the Office administers."
