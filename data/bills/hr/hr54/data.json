    "text": "Frank Lautenberg Memorial Secure Chemical Facilities Act\n\nAmends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to set forth provisions for the regulation of security practices at chemical facilities.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate: (1) any chemical substance as a substance of concern and establish and adjust the threshold quantity for each such substance after considering the potential extent of death, injury, and serious adverse effects that could result from a chemical facility terrorist incident; and (2) a chemical facility as a covered chemical facility if the Secretary determines such facility is a sufficient security risk (e.g., a likely target of a chemical facility terrorist incident and close to large population centers).\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) maintain a list of covered chemical facilities that are of sufficient security risk; (2) assign each covered facility to one of four risk-based tiers; (3) establish standards and procedures for security vulnerability assessments and site security plans; (4) require each facility owner or operator to submit and, once approved, to implement such an assessment and plan; and (5) establish risk-based chemical security performance standards for site security plans.\n\nPermits the Secretary, under specified circumstances, to: (1) accept an alternate security program submitted by the owner or operator of the facility, (2) conduct facility security inspections, and (3) obtain access to and copy records necessary for reviewing or analyzing a security vulnerability assessment or site security plan.\n\nRequires the Secretary to: (1) share threat information with owners, operators, or security officers of a covered chemical facility, with representative of bargaining agents at the facility, and with relevant state and local government authorities in a timely manner; (2) require a facility owner or operator to provide information concerning a threat to, or any unauthorized penetration of the physical security or cyber security of, the facility in a timely manner; and (3) disapprove and require revisions to a security vulnerability assessment or site security plan that does not comply with the requirements of this Act or that fails to meet security performance standards.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to: (1) issue an order assessing penalties for noncompliance with this Act, and (2) order a facility owner or operator that continues to be in noncompliance to cease facility operations.\n\nEstablishes whistleblower protections for employees of a covered chemical facility who report violations of this Act.\n\nProhibits the public disclosure of certain protected information related to security vulnerability assessments and site security plans developed pursuant to this Act.\n\nRequires: (1) the Secretary to make available information on the use and availability of methods to reduce the consequences of a chemical facility terrorist attack; (2) site security plans to include an assessment of such methods; and (3) the owner or operator of a tier 1 or tier 2 facility to implement such methods if the Director of the Office of Chemical Facility Security determines that such implementation would significantly reduce the risk of death, injury, or serious adverse effects to human health resulting from a terrorist incident, can feasibly be incorporated into facility operations, and would not significantly impair the owner's or operator's ability to continue the business of the facility at its location.\n\nRequires the Secretary to provide guidance and appropriate, tools, methodologies, or computer software to assist farm supplies merchant wholesalers and small covered chemical facilities in complying with this Act.\n\nExempts specified facilities from the requirements of this Act, including Department of Defense chemical facilities, Nuclear Regulatory Commission-regulated chemical facilities, public water systems, and treatment works.\n\nEstablishes in the Department of Homeland Security an Office of Chemical Facility Security.\n\nRequires the Secretary to require covered chemical facilities to establish personnel surety for facility employees by conducting appropriate security background checks and ensuring appropriate credentials for unescorted facility visitors and personnel.\n\nAuthorizes civil actions and citizen petitions by individuals alleging violations of this Act.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) establish a notification system to report, via telephonic and Internet-based means, a suspected security deficiency or suspected noncompliance with the requirements of this Act; (2) assess and report on the emergency response resources that would be required to feasibly respond to a worst-case chemical facility terrorist incident; and (3) report annually for 10 years on progress in achieving compliance with this Act.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for grants for methods to reduce the consequences of a terrorist attack FY2016-F2020.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary, until final rules issued to carry out this Act take effect, to: (1) continue to carry out existing Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards regulations, and (2) amend such regulations as necessary to ensure that they are consistent with this Act.\n\nRequires the Secretary to review the designation of sodium fluoroacetate as a substance of concern.\n\nProhibits the Secretary from using federal funds to approve a site security plan for a chemical facility unless the facility meets or exceeds security standards and requirements to protect the facility against acts of terrorism."
