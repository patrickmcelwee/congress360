The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 is amended to express the sense of Congress that the United States should support any state or local government that for moral, prudential, or reputational reasons divests from, or prohibits the investment of its assets in, any person that engages in investment or business activities with the IRGC or IRGC-related companies, as long as the IRGC is subject to U.S. economic sanctions.\n\nA state or local government may adopt and enforce specified divestment or investment prohibition measures. It is the sense of Congress that a state or local government should not adopt such a measure against a person unless it has made every effort to avoid erroneously targeting such person."
