The tax does not apply to exports of a taxable carbon substance.\n\nThe bill requires the Department of the Treasury to: (1) impose carbon equivalency fees on imports of goods containing or produced using a taxable carbon substance; and (2) make quarterly payments, from the amounts deposited pursuant to imposition of the carbon excise tax, to lawful residents of the United States with a valid social security number."
