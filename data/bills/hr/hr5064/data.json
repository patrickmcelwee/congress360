    "text": "Improving Small Business Cyber Security Act of 2016\n\nThis bill requires the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop a Small Business Development Center Cyber Strategy after the Government Accountability Office issues a report that reviews federal cybersecurity resources aimed at assisting small businesses. The strategy must include:\n\n plans for incorporating small business development centers (SBDCs) into existing cyber programs to assist small businesses; counsel and assistance to improve small businesses' cyber security infrastructure, threat awareness, and training programs for employees, including agreements with Information Sharing and Analysis Centers to gain awareness of actionable threat information that may be beneficial to small businesses; and an analysis of how SBDCs can leverage federal programs and develop partnerships with federal, state, and local governments and private entities to improve cyber support services to small businesses. The Small Business Act is amended to authorize the SBA to make SBDC grants in furtherance of such strategy. SBDCs shall have access to cyber security specialists to counsel their small business clients.\n\nThe Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Small Business Act are amended to authorize DHS and other federal agencies coordinating with DHS to assist SBDCs, through the dissemination of cyber security risk information and other homeland security information, to help small businesses in developing such cyber security infrastructure, threat awareness, and employee training programs."
