Requires the system to:\n\n incorporate multiple communications technologies, be designed to incorporate future technologies for communicating directly with the public to provide alerts to the largest portion of the affected population feasible and to improve the ability of remote areas to receive alerts, promote local and regional partnerships to enhance community preparedness and response, provide redundant alert mechanisms, and protect individual privacy. Directs FEMA to: (1) submit a detailed plan to implement the system, including a time line, a spending plan, and recommendations for any additional authority necessary; and (2) establish the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Advisory Committee to develop recommendations for the system."
