To obtain such a number a supplier must meet specified criteria.\n\nThe Secretary must: (1) review annually the coverage and utilization of orthotics and prosthetics to determine whether they should be subjected to coverage and utilization review criteria, and if appropriate (2) develop and apply such criteria.\n\nPatients are not liable for payment of furnished orthotics and prosthetics which are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member.\n\nCompetitive acquisition programs shall not apply to off-the-shelf items and services furnished by certain orthotists or prosthetists who are either licensed or, in a state without licensing requirements, meet specified training, education, certification, or credentialing criteria.\n\nRecoupment of payments to a qualifying provider or supplier may not be made before completion of an administrative law judge appeals process.\n\nPayment under Medicare is denied to suppliers and providers unless they meet certain licensing or other qualifications."
