If a non-stabilized emergency medical condition exists the VA hospital may not transfer the veteran unless the veteran, after being made aware of the risks, makes a written transfer request, or a physician (or a qualified medical person if a physician is not present) certifies that the medical benefits of a transfer outweigh the risks.\n\nThe VA may not take adverse action against a VA employee because the employee refuses to authorize the transfer of an enrolled veteran with a non-stabilized emergency medical condition or because the employee reports a violation of a requirement of this Act.\n\nA VA or non-VA medical facility may not delay provision of an appropriate medical screening examination or further medical examination and treatment required in order to inquire about the payment method or insurance status of an enrolled veteran."
