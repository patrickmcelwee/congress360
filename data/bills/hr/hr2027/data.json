Makes funds available for such assistance pursuant to final judgment of a specified legal case.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that the President should support efforts by the people of Boko Haram-affected areas and the governments of Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, and Niger to:\n\n assist internally displaced people and returnees; enhance the administrative competency of state and local governance institutions and public agencies in northeast Nigeria; provide all children with a quality basic education while ensuring student and faculty safety; strengthen the operational capacity of the civilian police in Nigeria, and strengthen measures to prevent corruption; and promote programs to address physical harm and psychosocial trauma. Expresses the sense of Congress that:\n\n the Secretary of State and Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development should work with Congress to increase future assistance to support reconstruction activities if Nigeria demonstrates a commitment to transparent reconstruction in Boko Haram-affected areas of Nigeria, and the Secretary should withhold assistance if Nigeria is not committed to transparent reconstruction and reconciliation in the Boko Haram-affected areas of Nigeria."
