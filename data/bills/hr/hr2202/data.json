The tax is equal to $30 per metric ton of carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide equivalent in 2016, increasing each subsequent year at 4% above inflation.\n\nThe bill amends the Social Security Act to establish a Low-Income Cost Mitigation Program to provide an energy refund amount to certain low and middle-income households to compensate such households for increases in energy costs due to this bill.\n\nThe Department of Labor may use revenues generated by this bill to implement a program to assist displaced workers in the coal industry.\n\nThe bill also provides for a gradual reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 32% in taxable years beginning in 2016 to 28% in taxable years beginning after 2019.\n\nThe bill requires the Department of the Treasury to establish a website to make information regarding the amount and sources of revenue attributable to this bill publicly available."
