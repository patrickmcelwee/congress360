Requires the Secretary to safeguard VA network infrastructure, computers, and servers.\n\nDirects the Secretary to protect the confidentiality of sensitive personal information of veterans by:\n\n providing upgrades or phaseouts of outdated or unsupported operating systems to protect against harmful viruses and malicious software; and securing VA web applications and the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (commonly referred to as the \"Vista system,\" which allows for an integrated inpatient and outpatient electronic health record for patients and provides administrative tools to VA employees). Directs the Secretary to submit certifications to Congress regarding the VA's compliance with information security requirements, including actions required by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nRequires the Secretary to submit monthly reports to Congress regarding security vulnerabilities discovered after performing regular scans of VA computers and servers."
