Extends such program to all states. Requires states that receive state criminal alien assistance program (SCAAP) funds to comply with program requirements.\n\nAuthorizes state or local detention of certain aliens, in specified circumstances, after completion of their state or local prison sentence.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for SCAAP.\n\nTransfers SCAAP jurisdiction from DOJ to DHS.\n\nRequires states and localities to: (1) notify the federal government of inadmissible or removable aliens who are encountered by law enforcement personnel, and (2) comply with federal law enforcement information requests and with DHS detainers.\n\nDenies specified federal law enforcement assistance to a state or a political subdivision that prohibits law enforcement officers from cooperating with federal immigration law enforcement.\n\nRevises certain terrorism-related requirements and prohibitions with respect to naturalization, asylum, good moral character, voluntary departure, and cancellation of removal.\n\nAuthorizes: (1) the denaturalization of a person who participates in terrorist activities or violent or unlawful activities aimed at the overthrow of the United States; and (2) the use or publication by DHS of certain legalization or special agricultural worker status information for any purpose relating to terrorism, national intelligence, or national security.\n\nRequires security and background checks and investigations of suspected immigration irregularities to be completed before specified immigration-related statuses and benefits may be granted or adjudicated.\n\nRevises and expands the definition of \"aggravated felony\" under INA.
