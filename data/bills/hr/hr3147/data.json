Each Member's office must make publicly available in print or on its congressional website all the constituent services it provides.\n\nIt is the sense of Congress that private companies that provide the same or similar assistance to individuals as described in the House of Representatives Administrative Reform Technical Corrections Act (as amended by this Act) should disclose that such assistance could be provided free by the office of a Member of the House of Representatives."
