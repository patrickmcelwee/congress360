After the lead agency issues a record of decision, federal agencies may only rely on the environmental document prepared by the lead agency.\n\nProjects may adopt certain environmental review documents of other projects located nearby or prepared by states under certain circumstances.\n\nThe bill sets forth provisions concerning requirements for initiating and completing environmental review for a project, including for: (1) determining the range of alternatives to be considered in environmental review documents, and (2) a schedule and deadlines for completing the review.\n\nA lead agency may not use the social cost of carbon in the environmental review or environmental decision making process.\n\nLimitations are placed on claims arising under federal law seeking judicial review of a permit, license, or approval issued by a federal agency for an action subject to NEPA."
