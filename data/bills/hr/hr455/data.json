For such analysis, the Secretary must consider and examine:\n\n technology needs and challenges; personnel needs and challenges; the role of state, local, and tribal law enforcement in general border security activities; the need for cooperation among federal, state, local, tribal, and Canadian law enforcement entities relating to border security; and the terrain, population density, and climate along the northern border."
