It nullifies any Act authorizing the TSA to perform any other security screening operations.\n\nThe Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 is amended to repeal the authority of the DHS Secretary, acting through the TSA Administrator, to develop Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response (VIPR) teams to augment security of public transportation."
