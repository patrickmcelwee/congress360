For all other sales, an authorized reseller must require purchasers to submit their: (1) credit or debit card account information, (2) Social Security number, (3) driver's license number, and (4) any personal identifying information that DOJ finds to be necessary.\n\nAuthorized resellers must make a record of their sales that includes: (1) the information obtained from purchasers to verify their identity; (2) the date of sale; (3) the manufacturer and the wireless carrier of the device or SIM card; (4) any assigned telephone number or other identifier of the subscriber or account; and (5) if applicable, the international mobile equipment identifier number, electronic serial number, mobile equipment identifier, international mobile subscriber identifier, and machine address code. Within 30 days after a sale, an authorized reseller must transmit such record to the wireless carrier for the device or SIM card.\n\nPurchasers are subject to criminal penalties for providing false or misleading identifying information or documents. A civil penalty is established for authorized resellers or wireless carriers who fail to comply with this Act.\n\nThe bill also prohibits and establishes criminal penalties for the sale of a pre-paid mobile device or SIM card by a person who is not an authorized reseller."
