    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nInspector General Empowerment Act of 2015\n\nThis bill amends the Inspector General Act of 1978 to enhance the investigatory powers of Inspectors General.\n\n(Sec. 2) This section grants Inspectors General subpoena authority to compel the attendance and testimony of certain witnesses, including federal contractors and former federal employees, in investigations of fraud or waste in excess of $100,000. However, if there is reasonable cause to believe a crime has been committed, the $100,000 threshold\u00a0shall not apply.\n\nPrior to issuing a subpoena, an Inspector General must submit a request for approval of a subpoena to a Subpoena Panel comprised of three Inspectors General of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency and then notify the Department of Justice (DOJ) of intent to issue\u00a0the subpoena. DOJ retains the power to approve or deny the issuance of a subpoena.\n\nInspectors General may compare, through a matching program, federal records with other federal or non-federal records, while conducting an audit or other review to identify weaknesses that may lead to waste, fraud, or abuse and to detect improper payments and fraud. This authority is not restricted by privacy protections in the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988.\n\n(Sec. 3) The Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency is charged with receiving, reviewing, and mediating any disputes involving the jurisdiction of more than one federal agency or entity.\n\nThe Integrity Committee of the Council must make an expedited determination of whether to initiate an investigation of allegations of wrongdoing\u00a0 and must complete an investigation within six months after making such determination.\n\n(Sec. 4) This section exempts from Paperwork Reduction Act requirements: (1) information collected during any evaluation by the Federal Accountability and Spending Transparency Board; and (2) information collected during any audit, investigation, inspection, evaluation, or other review conducted by the Council or any Office of the Inspector General, including any Office of Special Inspector General.\n\n(Sec. 5) The Integrity Committee is granted the authority to investigate an allegation of wrongdoing against the Special Counsel or the Deputy Special Counsel (officials appointed to investigate prohibited personnel practices and government waste and abuse) on the same basis as an investigation of an allegation against an Inspector General.\n\n(Sec. 6) This section requires: (1) the Government Accountability Office to study and report on prolonged vacancies in the offices of Inspector General, and (2) the Council to conduct and report on an analysis of critical issues that involve the jurisdiction of more than one Office of Inspector General.\n\n(Sec. 7) This section requires the public disclosure of any finding of misconduct, including any violation of federal law or agency policy, by any member of the Senior Executive Service, an employee excepted from the competitive service, or certain commissioned officers in the U.S. Army."
