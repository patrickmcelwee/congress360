Within 30 days after enactment of this bill the TSA shall:\n\n utilize TSA Behavior Detection Officers to verify traveler documents, particularly at designated PreCheck lanes to ensure that they are operational for use and maximum efficiency; make every practicable effort to grant additional flexibility and authority to Federal Security Directors in matters related to checkpoint and checked baggage staffing allocation and employee overtime; disseminate to air carriers, airport operators, and appropriate TSA personnel a list of checkpoint optimization best practices; expand efforts to increase the public's participation in the TSA PreCheck program; and direct the Aviation Security Advisory Committee to make recommendations within 60 days on checkpoint operations optimization. By the same 30-day deadline the TSA shall establish:\n\n a staffing advisory working group at each airport at which the TSA oversees or performs passenger security screening to coordinate a service level agreement and minimum TSA staffing numbers, and a staffing advisory committee at the national level to coordinate and share information relating to best practices concerning TSA staffing numbers being given to airports."
