Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006, and the Small Business Act; (2) within one year after this Act's enactment, the Erma Byrd Scholarship program; and (3) within three years after this Act's enactment, each competitive grant program administered by the Department of Education (ED), with specified exceptions.\n\nRequires ED, within one year after a program under this Act is repealed, to reduce the ED workforce by the number of full-time ED employee positions associated with such program."
