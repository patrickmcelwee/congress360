Sets forth congressional procedures for the expedited consideration of a bill containing such legislation.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Transportation to establish a regional infrastructure accelerator pilot program to assist public entities in developing infrastructure projects.\n\nEstablishes a deadline of 18 months after the enactment of this Act\u00a0for the enactment of legislation that reforms the international tax system by eliminating the incentive to hold earnings in low-tax jurisdictions. Imposes a tax on repatriated offshore corporate earnings upon the expiration of the deadline.\n\nSets forth provisions for the reform of the international tax system (to be effective if reform legislation is not enacted by the 18-month deadline established by this Act), including provisions relating to subpart F income and insurance income, gains and losses from the sale or exchange of stock in controlled foreign corporations, limitations on the foreign tax credit, and the tax treatment of previously deferred foreign income."
