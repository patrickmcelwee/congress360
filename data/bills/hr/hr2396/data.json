The FDA must classify an accessory of a medical device independently from the medical device with which it is used.\n\nHealth software is exempted from regulation by the FDA (including as a medical device), except for software that provides patient-specific recommendations and poses a significant risk to patient safety.\n\nThe FDA must review existing regulations and guidance regarding the regulation of health software."
