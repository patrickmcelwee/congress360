The bill increases overall FY2017 Energy and Water Development funding above FY2016 levels. The bill includes increases for both DOE and the Army Corps of Engineers, while funding the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation at the FY2016 level.\n\nWithin the DOE budget, the bill increases funding for Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration.\n\nThe bill does not include FY2017 funding for Nuclear Waste Disposal. It authorizes DOE to conduct a pilot program with private sector partners to provide interim storage for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.\n\nAlso included in the bill is a provision restricting the Corps of Engineers from advancing regulations changing the definition of \"fill material\" or \"discharge of fill material\" under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act).\n\nFull Summary: \n\nEnergy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 \n\nTITLE I--CORPS OF ENGINEERS--CIVIL\n\nProvides appropriations to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for authorized civil functions pertaining to rivers and harbors, flood and storm damage reduction, shore protection, aquatic ecosystem restoration, and related efforts.\n\nProvides appropriations to the Corps of Engineers for:\n\n Investigations; Construction; Mississippi River and Tributaries, including flood damage reduction projects in the Mississippi River alluvial valley below Cape Girardeau, Missouri; Operation and Maintenance; the Regulatory Program pertaining to navigable waters and wetlands; the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program for clean-up of early atomic energy program contamination; Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies, including hurricanes, floods, and other natural disasters; Expenses necessary for the supervision and general administration of the civil works program; and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. (Sec. 101) Establishes reprogramming guidelines and requirements for funds provided in this title. Prohibits the availability of funds for obligation or expenditure through reprogramming that would: (1) create, initiate, or eliminate a program, project, or activity; (2) increase funds or personnel for any program, project, or activity for which funds are either denied or restricted by this bill; (3) reduce funds that are directed to be used for a specific purpose by this bill; or (4) reprogram funds for specific projects, programs, or activities by more than specified amounts.\n\nSpecifies exceptions and requires the Corps of Engineers to submit a report to Congress establishing the baseline for application of reprogramming and transfer authorities for the current fiscal year.\n\nProhibits funds provided by this title from being used for a contract that commits funds beyond the amounts appropriated for that program, project, or activity that remain unobligated. Includes exception for funds made available through reprogramming.\n\n(Sec. 102) Permits the Corps of Engineers to transfer to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service up to $5.4 million in Operation and Maintenance funds to mitigate for fisheries lost due to Corps of Engineers civil works projects.\n\n(Sec. 103) Prohibits the Corps of Engineers from using funds to develop, adopt, implement, administer, or enforce any change to regulations in effect on October 1, 2012, pertaining to the definitions of \"fill material\" or \"discharge of fill material\" for the purposes of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act).\n\n(Sec. 104) Prohibits funds provided by this bill from being used for open lake disposal of dredged sediment in Lake Erie unless the disposal meets the water and environmental standards of a state's water permitting agency and is consistent with a state's Coastal Zone Management Plan.
