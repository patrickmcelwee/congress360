(A Section 232 loan is insured by the Federal Housing Administration and may be used to finance or refinance the purchase, construction, or renovation of a nursing home or assisted living facility.)\n\nA nursing home becomes ineligible for a Section 232 loan if, for any period of 30 or more consecutive months, the home achieves two or fewer stars under the five-star quality rating system established pursuant to the Social Security Act for purposes of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. However, a nursing home's eligibility shall be renewed if the home subsequently maintains a rating of three or more stars for a period of at least 30 consecutive months.\n\nThe bill does not affect existing mortgages."
