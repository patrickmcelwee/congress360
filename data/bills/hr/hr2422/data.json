    "text": "This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to establish a third-party quality system assessment program to accredit persons to assess whether a medical device manufacturer's quality system can ensure the safety and effectiveness of an approved medical device after certain changes, including changes in manufacturing or changes to enhance device safety.\n\nDevice manufacturers are allowed to make changes to a device without submitting to the FDA the 30-day notice required for manufacturing changes or a premarket approval supplement if their quality system has been certified by an accredited person.\n\nAn accredited person who assesses a device manufacturer's quality system must submit a summary of their assessment and, as appropriate, a certification to the FDA within 30 days of the assessment. An assessment summary and certification is deemed accepted by the FDA 30 days after submission unless the FDA determines that additional information is needed to support certification, the assessment or certification is unwarranted, or an action other than acceptance of the certification is otherwise justified.\n\nPeriodic reports by device manufacturers must describe any changes made to a device without submission of the 30-day notice or the premarket approval supplement.\n\nCertifications accepted by the FDA remain in effect for two years.\n\nThe FDA must report on this quality system assessment program no later than January 31, 2022. The program is terminated at the end of FY2022."
