    "text": "Preserving Public Access to Federal Buildings Act of 2016\n\nThis bill requires an executive agency to provide notice and an opportunity for public comment before relocating any agency office that has regular contact with the public. Such requirement shall apply to a relocation proposed by the agency or a reassignment of agency office space by the General Services Administration.\n\nBefore providing notice, an agency shall determine if it expects the relocation to impact the ability of the office's clientele to access its services. If so, the agency shall develop an initial plan to address the impact.\n\nIf the announced relocation receives substantial public interest, the agency shall:\n\n conduct an in-depth evaluation of the potential impact of the relocation on the ability of the office's clientele to access services; develop a plan to address such impact or revise the initial plan; and publish the results of the evaluation and a description of the plan on the agency's website. The Office of Management and Budget must issue guidance for agencies on the meaning of \"regular contact with the public\" and \"substantial public interest.\""
