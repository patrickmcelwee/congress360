DOT shall also:\n\n ensure that FAA cybersecurity R&D is constantly updated to reflect the evolving nature of cyber risks and threats, and develop an agencywide threat model. The GAO shall review:\n\n the effectiveness of the six FAA unmanned aircraft (drone) system test sites and the opportunities for coordinating and integrating the research at them with research by the Center of Excellence on Unmanned Aircraft Systems; and federal government research on aircraft noise levels and its use to inform the DOT noise evaluation processes, adjustments to noise metrics, and development of noise abatement procedures. DOT shall:\n\n develop an R&D strategy to inform any potential regulatory action regarding the safe integration of evolving drone systems into the National Airspace System, hold at least one workshop to discuss the status of R&D on enhancing general aviation safety, develop a research plan on safety risk assessment methods for development of airport design standards, and develop a plan to implement standards for aircraft cabin air contaminants. The GAO shall review the role of FAA's Research, Engineering, and Development Advisory Committee in advising about:\n\n the organization, management, and budgetary structure of R&D programs across FAA, and both near-term budget planning and long-term strategic planning for the comprehensive FAA R&D portfolio. DOT shall also arrange for an independent external study to identify the implications that a potential nongovernment U.S. air traffic control system could have on FAA's R&D activities."
