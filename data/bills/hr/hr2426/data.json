(Currently, a report is needed for a class I device only if the device is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health or if it presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.)\n\nNot later than 180 days after enactment of the 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA must publish a list of types of class II medical devices (devices that need special controls to assure their safety and effectiveness) for which a report is no longer needed prior to marketing to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. (Currently, such a list must be published each time the FDA exempts a type of class II device from the reporting requirement.) The public comment period for such an exemption is extended to 60 days."
