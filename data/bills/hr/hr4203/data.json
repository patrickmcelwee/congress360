If an aircraft lacks an adequate number of functioning lavatories at the time of boarding, the carrier shall permit a ticketed passenger to select alternative equivalent air transportation operated by such carrier without charging an additional fee.\n\n A carrier must refund any baggage fee for baggage that does not arrive within two hours after the passenger arrives at the scheduled destination."
