(Currently, the extended one-year period is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2015, and return to a nine-month period under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.)\n\nRevives, effective January 1, 2017 (currently, January 1, 2016), the old nine-month period in place of the one-year period granted by such Act."
