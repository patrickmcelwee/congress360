    "text": "Federal Employee Short-Term Disability Insurance Act of 2015\n\nRequires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish and administer a program for short-term (i.e., up to 12 months) disability insurance coverage for federal employees for: (1) an injury or disability that is not work related, (2) leave to care for a family member, and (3) leave to make arrangements to become a foster parent or to adopt a child. Disqualifies an employee for such insurance if an injury or disability is caused by willful misconduct, a self-inflicted injury, or intoxication.\n\nRequires the Director to contract with one or more insurance carriers for disability insurance coverage plans, without regard to competitive bidding requirements. Requires such plans to contain a detailed statement of benefits offered, the premiums charged, and the duration of the enrollment period.\n\nAuthorizes the Director to prescribe reasonable minimum standards for benefits offered by such plans, including a prohibition against excluding or penalizing an employee for a preexisting condition.\n\nRequires individuals eligible for coverage under a disability insurance plan to be responsible for 100% of the premiums for the coverage offered.\n\nEstablishes in the Employees' Life Insurance Fund a Non-Work Related Disability Insurance Administrative Account, which shall be available to OPM to defray reasonable expenses incurred in administering this Act and to which contracted carriers shall make contributions necessary to cover such expenses."
