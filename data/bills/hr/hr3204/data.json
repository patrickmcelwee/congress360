    "text": "Tackling Excessive Standardized Testing Act of 2015 or the TEST Act of 2015\n\nThis bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to lower the frequency with which students must take the tests used to determine whether they are making adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward state academic achievement standards in mathematics and reading or language arts. Under current law, students must take such tests in both subjects in each of grades 3 through 8. The bill maintains testing in grades 3 through 8 but authorizes a public school to\u00a0limit testing: (1)\u00a0in mathematics, to even-numbered\u00a0grades or, if the school is at the 15th percentile or above for mathematics in the state or its students are making appropriate progress toward state mathematics achievement standards,\u00a0to grades 4 and 8 only; and (2)\u00a0in reading or language arts, to odd-numbered grades or, if the school is at the 15th percentile or above for reading or language arts or its students are making appropriate progress toward state reading or language arts achievement standards,\u00a0to grades 3 and 7 only.\n\nLimited English proficient students who are in their first 12 months of enrollment in a public school are excluded from the determination as to whether students are making AYP toward state academic achievement standards."
