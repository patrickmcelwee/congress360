The reports must: (1) identify persons that have knowingly facilitated, participated or assisted in, engaged in, directed, or provided material support for such activities; (2) describe their conduct; (3) assess the Iranian government's or other foreign governments' direction, facilitation, or material support in such activities; and (4) provide a strategy to counter efforts by persons to conduct such activities, which shall include engaging foreign governments to halt the capabilities of such persons.\n\nThe President must include on the Office of Foreign Assets Control's specially designated nationals and blocked persons list persons who are: (1) identified in such reports; or (2) indicted by the Department of Justice in connection with such activities undermining U.S. cybersecurity. Under an exception, the President may exclude such a person from the list by submitting an explanation to Congress.\n\nThe President must use Executive Order 13694 (relating to blocking the property of certain persons engaging in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities) to impose sanctions against persons included on such list."
