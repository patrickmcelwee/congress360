(A spontaneous abortion is the death of a fetus before the age of viability, also known as a miscarriage.) Research with human fetal tissue conducted or supported by the NIH must meet requirements, including informed consent requirements for the donor and researcher, currently applied only to research on the transplantation of human fetal tissue for therapeutic purposes."
