Requires that the mechanism established by the Secretary to recognize the costs of new medical services and technologies that are not DISARM antimicrobial drugs under the Medicare payment system is applicable to new medical services or technology if the service or technology is not a DISARM antimicrobial drug.\n\nDirects the Comptroller General to study the barriers that prevent the development of DISARM antimicrobial drugs and develop recommendations for actions to be taken in order to overcome those barriers."
