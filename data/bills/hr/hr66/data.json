Requires release to the public of unclassified summaries and reports if the Attorney General determines that a decision may not be declassified.\n\nRequires the Attorney General, in cases in which an unclassified summary may not be made available, to make publicly available an unclassified report on the status of the internal deliberations and process regarding the declassification by executive branch personnel of such decisions, including estimates of the number of decisions that will be declassified or remain classified."
