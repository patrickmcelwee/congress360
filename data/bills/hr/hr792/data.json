Requires the department concerned to offer for sale an equal number of acres of federal land that is under the same jurisdictional status.\n\nExempts from this requirement any easements acquired to facilitate management of federal lands.\n\nRequires land sold pursuant to this Act to be offered for sale at fair market value (based on local comparable sales), with monthly price reductions if the land is not sold in six months.\n\n Requires all net proceeds from the sale of federal lands pursuant to this Act to be deposited directly into the Treasury for reduction of the public debt."
