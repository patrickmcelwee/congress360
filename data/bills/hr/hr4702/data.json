The GPO shall ensure that the website is updated contemporaneously, automatically, and electronically to include each new or updated CRS Report.\n\nBefore transmitting a CRS Report to the GPO for publication on the website, CRS may remove the name of, and any contact information for, any CRS employee.\n\nThe Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 is amended to require CRS to comply with this Act."
