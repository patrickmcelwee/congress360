Requires the Secretary of Commerce to make available information on federal and state-led trade missions, trade fairs, and related activities on the Export.gov website.\n\nRequires the governmentwide strategic plan for federal trade promotion efforts to:\n\n clearly identify and explain the role, goals, and objectives of each TPCC member agency with respect its export promotion and export financing activities; include the recommendations of the Comptroller General relating to coordination of the TPCC and member agencies; and reflect the recommendations of the U.S. Travel Association (currently, U.S. National Tourism Organization) to the degree considered appropriate by the TPCC. Directs the TPCC to establish a working group to advise it on matters relating to state trade promotion.\n\nRevises membership of the TPCC to include representatives from the Millennium Challenge Corporation, as well as one ex officio, nonvoting presidential appointee representing a state trade promotion agency and who is a member of the working group.\n\nRequires the Inspector General of the Department of Commerce to report biennially to Congress on the extent to which the TPCC is successfully carrying out its duties."
