Prohibits each executive agency from obligating more than the reduced dollar amount for FY2010 to purchase and lease civilian vehicles in each of FY2016-FY2020. Exempts the purchase or procurement of any vehicle determined by the President to be essential for reasons of national security.\n\nRequires the General Services Administration\u00a0to ensure that agencies may share excess or unused vehicles for temporary or long-term use through the Federal Fleet Management System."
