Defines \"strategic sourcing\" as a structured and collaborative process of critically analyzing an organization's spending patterns to better leverage its purchasing power, reduce costs, and improve overall value and performance.\n\nRequires the Office of Management and Budget to: (1) issue guidance to executive agencies for implementing the strategic sourcing goals established by this Act, and (2) report on spending for goods and services that was strategically sourced and the extent of the savings realized.\n\nDirects the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Energy, Veterans Affairs, and Health and Human Services, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the General Services Administration, and the Small Business Administration to take certain actions to support strategic sourcing, including establishing department wide-goals and savings targets for strategic sourcing efforts and a strategic sourcing accountability official.\n\nDirects the Comptroller General to: (1) conduct studies on contract utilization fees and on establishing strategic sourcing initiative contract vehicles, and (2) assess and report on the performance of executive agencies in implementing the strategic sourcing goals required by this Act and the amounts saved through the use of strategic sourcing."
