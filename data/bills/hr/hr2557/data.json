The EPA must publish this information for FY2008 and each subsequent fiscal year.\n\nA new or revised national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) cannot apply to the review and disposition of a preconstruction permit application unless the EPA publishes implementation guidance with the NAAQS.\n\nThe EPA has to submit annually a report on actions to expedite the process for review of preconstruction permits."
