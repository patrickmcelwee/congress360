Sets forth permissible subgrant activities.\n\nRevises subpart 3 of part A to require each state, directly or through subgrants to institutions of higher education, LEAs, schools or colleges of education, nonprofit organizations, or partnerships of such entities, to use a portion of its remaining allotment to:\n\n assist each teacher preparation program that has been identified as low-performing or that is at risk of being identified as such, and terminate programs identified as low-performing after such assistance and a period of time for program improvement has been provided. Set forth permissible subpart 3 activities.\n\nRevises subpart 4 of part A to require states that receive an allotment under subpart 1, and LEAs that receive a subgrant under subpart 2, to report annually to the Secretary of Education and their state, respectively, on the performance and results of their respective programs under those subparts.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to withhold part A administrative funds from states that, for three consecutive academic years, demonstrate no progress in making student access to effective teachers more equitable.\n\nDefines a \"high-need LEA\" for purposes of the national activities under subpart 5 of part A. Replaces the national teacher recruitment campaign with a program authorizing the Secretary to award grants to national nonprofit organizations for projects to: (1) recruit and select educators, or (2) prepare or provide professional enhancement activities for educators.\n\nRedefines \"professional development\" under the ESEA as job-embedded comprehensive, sustained, targeted, intensive, evidence-based, and classroom-focused support and capacity-building for educators that strengthens classroom practice and increases student learning. Lists additional requirements for professional development activities."
