Product websites must include: (1) the CAS Registry Number of each ingredient, and (2) an explanation of each ingredient's purpose.\n\nA product that is not in conformity with the labeling and website listing requirements shall be treated as a misbranded hazardous substance under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act.\n\nA person may petition the Consumer Product Safety Commission to investigate claims that a product does not satisfy these requirements."
