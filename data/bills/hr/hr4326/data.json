The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nSmall and Disadvantaged Business Enhancement Act of 2016\n\n( Sec. 2) This bill amends the Small Business Act to allow for the management of each Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) to be vested in an individual whose primary responsibilities were for the functions and duties of: (1) the procurement program for small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, and (2) the HUBZone program.\n\nThe OSDBU of each federal agency with procurement powers shall review agency purchases that are greater than the micro-purchase threshold ($3,000) and less than the simplified acquisition threshold ($100,000) to ensure that the purchases have been made to comply with the Act and have been properly recorded in the Federal Procurement Data System, if the method of payment is a purchase card issued by the Department of Defense or by an executive agency head.\n\nEach OSDBU must cite in its annual report to Congress any failure to comply with such a program."
