As part of such analysis, the Secretary shall consider and examine:\n\n technology, personnel, and infrastructure needs and challenges; the roles and authorities of law enforcement; the status of coordination among law enforcement entities; the terrain, population density, and climate along the southwest border; and international agreements between the United States and Mexico. (Sec. 3) The bill requires the Chief of the Border Patrol, within 180 days after submission of the threat analysis and every five years thereafter, to issue a Border Patrol Strategic Plan that includes consideration of:\n\n the southwest border threat analysis; efforts to analyze and disseminate border security and border threat information between DHS components and with other federal agencies with missions associated with the border; efforts to increase situational awareness, to detect and prevent terrorists and instruments of terrorism from entering the United States, and to detect, interdict, and disrupt aliens and illicit drugs at the earliest possible point upon entry into the United States; efforts to focus intelligence collection to disrupt transnational criminal organizations outside of U.S. borders; efforts to ensure that any new border security technology can be operationally integrated with existing DHS technologies; technology required to maintain, support, and enhance security and facilitate trade at ports of entry; operational coordination unity of effort initiatives of DHS border security components; lessons learned from Operation Jumpstart and Operation Phalanx; cooperative agreements and information sharing with agencies that have jurisdiction on the borders; border security information received from consultation with such agencies and from border community stakeholders; staffing requirements; a prioritized list of departmental research and development objectives; an assessment of training programs for detecting fraudulent documents, understanding the scope of enforcement authorities and the use of force policies, and screening, identifying, and addressing vulnerable populations; and an assessment of how border security operations affect crossing times."
