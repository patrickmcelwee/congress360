    "text": "Preventing and Reducing Improper Medicare and Medicaid Expenditures to Restore Integrity to Benefits Act of 2015\n\nThis bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to make several changes related to the prevention of Medicaid fraud.\n\nWith respect to the Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP), the bill: (1) specifies that program appropriations\u00a0may cover costs of equipment, travel, training, and salaries and benefits; and (2) allows the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) flexibility in determining the number of additional staff necessary to carry out the program. (MIP is a federal program aimed at preventing and reducing provider fraud, waste, and abuse in the Medicaid program.)\n\nUnder current law, HHS may contract with Medicare administrative contractors (MACs), which are\u00a0private\u00a0insurers that process Medicare claims within\u00a0specified geographic jurisdictions. The bill\u00a0requires HHS to provide specified incentives for MACs to reduce improper payment error rates within their jurisdictions.\n\nThe bill establishes criminal penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment and up to $500,000 in fines for illegally purchasing or distributing Medicare, Medicaid, or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) beneficiary identification or billing privileges.\n\nThe bill increases the scope of the Medicare-Medicaid Data Match Program (Medi-Medi Program), an existing program through which contractors and participating\u00a0governmental agencies collaboratively analyze\u00a0Medicare and Medicaid billing trends. HHS must establish a plan to encourage states to participate in the Medi-Medi Program.\n\nHHS shall develop and implement a plan to allow states to access relevant data on improper or fraudulent payments made under the Medicare program on behalf of individuals dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid."
