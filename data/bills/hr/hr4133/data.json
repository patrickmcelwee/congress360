    "text": "Public Housing Accountability Act of 2015\n\nThis bill amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to add a requirement for periodic review of family income with respect to rental assistance for low-income families.\n\nReviews of family income shall be made at any time the family income changes by an amount estimated to result in an increase of 10% or more in annual adjusted income (or such other amount as the Department of Housing and Urban Development may establish). A public housing agency (PHA) or owner may elect not to conduct such a review in the last three months of a period during which the family is certified eligible for rental assistance.\n\nThe bill also revises the authorization for a PHA that owns or operates fewer than 250 units to lease a dwelling unit in a public housing project, on a month-to-month basis, to an over-income family if there are no eligible families applying to the PHA for housing assistance for that month. The PHA must give a 30-day notice-to-vacate, subject to a specified appeal procedure, to any family determined over-income because of an income review."
