    "text": "Dine College Act of 2015\n\nAuthorizes Dine College to receive federal funding and resources for its operation, improvement, and growth, including to:\n\n provide higher education programs and vocational and technical education for citizens of the Navajo Nation and others; preserve and protect the Navajo language, philosophy, and culture for citizens of the Navajo Nation and others; provide Navajo communities and people with employment and training opportunities; provide economic development and community outreach for Navajo communities and people; and provide a safe learning, working, and living environment for students, employees, and the public. Authorizes appropriations to Dine College to pay for its operation and maintenance. Allows such funds to be treated as non-federal, private funds for purposes of any provision of federal law that requires that non-federal or private funds of the College be used in a project for a specific purpose. Directs the Department of the Interior to fund the operation and maintenance of the College separately from tribal colleges and universities recognized and funded by the Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act of 1978.\n\nDirects: (1) an inventory prepared by the College identifying repairs, alterations, and renovations to facilities required to meet health and safety standards and other factors to be submitted to Interior by January 31, 2016; (2) Interior to conduct a detailed survey of all capital projects and facility needs of the College and to report to specified congressional committees by October 31, 2016; and (3) Interior to use the College's inventory as baseline data to inform the survey. Authorizes the College to use funds provided under this Act to undertake any renovations and repairs to the infrastructure of the College identified in the survey."
