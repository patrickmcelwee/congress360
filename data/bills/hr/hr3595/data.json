(Existing award levels are maintained for each of FY2017-FY2024.)\n\nThe VA shall reduce the retirement annuity benefits of a senior executive employee who: (1) is convicted of a felony that influenced the individual's performance while employed in the senior executive position, and (2) is afforded notice and an opportunity for a hearing conducted by another federal department or agency.\n\nThe VA may issue an order directing a VA employee to repay in full or in part any award or bonus if: (1) the VA determines such repayment appropriate pursuant to specified regulations, and (2) the employee is afforded notice and an opportunity for a hearing conducted by another federal department or agency.\n\nA VA decision regarding a repayment is final and not subject to review by other federal agencies or courts."
