    "text": "Rural Broadband Infrastructure Investment Act \n\nThis bill amends the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to authorize the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to provide additional loans and grants for the development of telecommunications and broadband services in rural areas.\n\nUSDA may give preference to loan applications for projects that support the development of telecommunications services in rural areas on a multijurisdictional basis.\n\nIn evaluating applications, USDA must consider whether:\n\n the project was developed through the collaboration and participation of multiple stakeholders in the service area; the applicant understands the regional resources that could support the project, including natural resources, human resources, infrastructure, and financial resources; and the project has clear objectives and a means to establish performance measures. For the purpose of loans, loan guarantees, and grants, a rural area is any area of the United States not included within the boundaries of any incorporated or unincorporated city, village, or borough having a population in excess of 20,000 inhabitants.\n\nUSDA may provide grants, in addition to loans and loan guarantees permitted under current law, for the construction, improvement, and acquisition of facilities and equipment for broadband service in rural areas. In providing loans, loan guarantees, and grants, USDA may give priority to multijurisdictional projects for the development of broadband service in rural areas that are developed through the collaboration and participation of multiple stakeholders in the service area."
