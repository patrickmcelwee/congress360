The Comptroller General is required to submit an assessment evaluating the effectiveness of the program.\n\n(Sec. 3) This section requires the Director to report to Congress on the feasibility of developing model exercises to test the preparedness of jurisdictions participating in the program in meeting the challenges that may be posed by a range of nuclear and radiological threats."
