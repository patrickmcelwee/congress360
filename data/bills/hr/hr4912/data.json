    "text": "Taxpayer Protection Act of 2016 \n\nThis bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish additional requirements and procedures for collecting taxes, regulating tax preparers, responding to identity theft, and assisting low-income taxpayers.\n\nThe bill repeals the authority of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to contract with private companies to collect federal tax debts. It also excludes from the gross income of an individual up to $10,000 of income from the discharge of a debt over the individual's lifetime.\n\nThe bill requires the statute of limitations for a taxpayer's case to continue to run during a pending application for assistance from the National Taxpayer Advocate.\n\nThe bill also:\n\n establishes limitations on IRS levies of retirement accounts, suspends the time limit for returning wrongfully levied property if a taxpayer is financially disabled, increases the grace period for withdrawing a frivolous return, and repeals the requirement to submit a partial payment with an offer-in-compromise to settle a tax liability. The IRS must notify victims of identity theft regarding an unauthorized use of the taxpayer's identify or the filing of criminal charges regarding the use of the identity.\n\nThe IRS must also: (1) permit its employees to refer taxpayers to low-income taxpayer clinics, and (2) notify taxpayers who are eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit.\n\nThe IRS may regulate paid tax return preparers and disclose returns or return information necessary to publish decisions related to tax return preparer misconduct.\n\nThe bill provides additional funding to the IRS for Taxpayer Services and increases the funding that the IRS may allocate to low-income taxpayer clinics."
