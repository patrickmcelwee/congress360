Ford Federal Direct Loans. (Currently, the Department of Education may establish alternative standards and certain clinical training programs are grandfathered.)\n\nStudents continue to be eligible for a loan if, on the date of enactment of this Act, they are enrolled in a foreign medical school that loses eligibility as a result of this Act."
