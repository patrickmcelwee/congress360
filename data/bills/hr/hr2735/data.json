The plans must incorporate objective numerical recovery goals for removal of species from the endangered and threatened species list.\n\nThe appropriate department is given 30 days to deny a petition stating that the numerical recovery goal has been achieved for a species. If the department has not acted on a petition at the end of that period, the species is removed from the endangered and threatened species list."
