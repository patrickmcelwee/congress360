Extends to six years\u00a0the period for assessing and collecting underpayments of tax due to deductions claimed for wages paid to unauthorized aliens.\n\nDirects the Commissioner of Social Security and the Secretaries of Homeland Security (DHS)\u00a0and the Treasury to jointly establish a program to share information that may lead to the identification of unauthorized aliens. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to provide taxpayer identity information to the Commissioner of Social Security and the DHS Secretary on employers who paid nondeductible wages to unauthorized aliens and on the aliens to whom such wages were paid.\n\nAmends the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to: (1) make permanent the E-Verify Program for verifying the employment eligibility of alien workers, (2) apply such program to current employees in addition to new hires, (3) establish a rebuttable presumption that employers who participate in the E-Verify Program and obtain confirmation of identity and employment eligibility have not violated hiring requirements under such Act, and (4) allow employers participating in the E-Verify Program\u00a0to make a conditional offer of employment pending final verification of the identity and employment eligibility of the job applicant."
