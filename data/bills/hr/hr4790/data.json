Interior and USDA shall make available, free of charge, a certain quantity of America the Beautiful passes for use by specified schools or their students and their families.\n\nInterior and USDA shall study the overall impact that recreation on federal recreational land and water has on the U.S. economy and labor market.\n\nThe Forest Service, BLM, and National Park Service may develop respective management plans for extending the recreation season or increasing recreation use during the offseason.\n\nThe Forest Service and BLM shall include metrics on recreation use in specified evaluations of lands under their jurisdictions.\n\nThe Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall consider how land and water management decisions can enhance recreation opportunities and the recreation economy.\n\nThe bill amends the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 to prescribe requirements for deposit, administration, and distribution of revenues collected from rental charges for certain ski area permits issued on National Forest System lands.\n\nThe bill establishes: (1) a National Recreation Area System, (2) a private sector volunteer enhancement program, and (3) a priority trail maintenance program.\n\nInterior and USDA shall establish an interagency trail management plan under which federal land management agencies shall coordinate so that trails that cross jurisdictional boundaries between those agencies are uniformly managed and maintained.\n\nThe Public Lands Corps Act of 1993 is amended to conform to this Act."
