Sets forth exceptions that: (1) authorize the CPSC to provide for alternative markings or devices, or (2) require former Commerce regulations concerning approved markings to be considered approved by the CPSC in the absence of any CPSC regulations.\n\nExpands the categories of look-alike firearms subject to such marking requirements and regulations to include product cases or covers that have the appearance, shape, or configuration of a firearm.\n\nRepeals Commerce's authorities for approving alternative markings and penalizing violations. Requires violations to instead be treated under the CPSIA."
