These determinations shall be subject to expedited reconsideration and appeal. A PDP sponsor must review and consider an at-risk beneficiary's preferences regarding prescriber and pharmacy selection.\n\nCertain individuals, including those receiving hospice care or residing in a long-term care facility, are exempted from enrollment in a drug management program.\n\nCMS must, for purposes of quality or performance assessments, review and consider complaints received from at-risk beneficiaries regarding lack of access due to their enrollment in a drug management program. In addition, CMS must establish rules and procedures requiring a PDP sponsor to provide specified program data."
