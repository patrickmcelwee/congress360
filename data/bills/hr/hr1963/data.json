Expands the program of agency incentives for conserving energy to include in utility incentive programs measures to support the use of low emission and fuel efficient USPS vehicles.\n\nProhibits USPS from awarding a contract for a vehicle, or purchasing or leasing a vehicle for use by USPS, including a passenger car, light truck, or medium or heavy-duty vehicle, unless the vehicle meets certain minimum carbon dioxide emissions standards and average fuel economy standards.\n\nProhibits USPS from meeting the requirements of this Act by: (1) reducing the frequency of mail delivery, (2) closing post offices or postal distribution facilities, (3) taking any action to restrict or diminish a collective bargaining agreement or eliminate or reduce employee benefits, or (4) entering into a contact with a private company to perform duties that are currently performed by postal employees who are bargaining unit employees."
