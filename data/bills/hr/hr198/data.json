Requires states to coordinate with neighboring states to ensure multistate network continuity and connectivity.\n\nDirects the Secretary to establish a competitive grant program for capital investment projects that improve the efficiency of the national transportation system to move freight.\n\nLimits the federal share of project net capital costs to 80%.\n\nRequires a grant recipient to submit to the Secretary: (1) a project management plan and an annual financial plan for a project with a total cost of $500 million or more, or (2) an annual financial plan for a project with a total cost of $100 million or more."
